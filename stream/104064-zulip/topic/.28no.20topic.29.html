<p>Hello, I am participating in GCI. The BRL-CAD tasks are very ineteresting, especially the task "Do our 3D chess set tutorial and submit feedback" because I like chess and I can learn many things from it.</p>

<p>Yash Patel: Hello,</p>
<p>I hope you all are doing good and most importantly safe.</p>
<p>I am aiming for participating in this year's Google Season Of Docs and can't wait to help developing documentation.</p>
<p>I really liked this organization and went thoroughly through the website, documentation, and Github and it seems like I am really interested in contributing to this throughout the period of GSoD as well as later too.<br>
.<br>
I am eager to start working on it and would like to share my proposal statement of interest with you in a couple of days. As a part of it, I am really interested to get started on the development of documentation and eager to have some inputs from your side for a kickstart if there are some important points to consider.</p>
<p>Also, I hope I am not too late (primarily because of university end-semester exams) and have the slot still open for applying. It would be great to confirm from your side before any miscommunication.</p>
<p>If eligible, I would like to share my resume and some other links/samples for your reference. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Thanking You.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Yash R Patel</p>
<p>Yash Patel: I would like to receive some updates and guidance to start with if the technical writer is yet not hired for BRL-CAD GSoD 2021 :)</p>
