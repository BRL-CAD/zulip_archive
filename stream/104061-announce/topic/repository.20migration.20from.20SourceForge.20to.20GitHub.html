<p>For anyone not watching the commits, there are efforts under way to migrate off of SourceForge for primary source code hosting.  As we already have several repositories on GitHub, that is the intended new home.  Before that migration can happen, a lot of work by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112516">@starseeker</span> has been invested to make sure we have the best preservation of code history (including fixing some mistakes in the current repository).  The target for this is by the end of the month.  Details will be sent out as they become available.</p>
