<p>Hi All, If you have just a couple minutes to spare, please fill out this survey from a team of students at Texas A&amp;M working on BRL-CAD's physically-based rendering (PBR) support before 25 Apr 2022.  They'd like to get as much feedback as possible, so responses from anyone (ideally today) are appreciated:  <a href="https://forms.gle/cvQRtPHemx4FrEEY8">https://forms.gle/cvQRtPHemx4FrEEY8</a></p>
