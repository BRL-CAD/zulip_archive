<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I am interested in the project "Documentation that specifically caters to new users" for GSoD. I am working on the proposal as well. I have been writing my proposal based on points like these: <br>
- How will this documentation help new users who are not only new to BRL-CAD but might also be new to open-source.<br>
-  How this documentation must be structured so that new users know where they are headed and what they are doing.<br>
- How to make the new users feel at ease and not get overwhelmed by the big words.<br>
- Make sure that documentation showcases the real power of BRL-CAD and what various things users can do using it.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that must be included beside these points?</p>

<p>hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="220380">@Sahibpreet Kaur</span> It's technically your proposal, so it only must include the points you feel it must include.  The points you listed sound good on the surface.  I would also be interested in the process -- how do you go about writing documentation that fulfills those points, can you prove in some way that they do (beyond saying "it does"), how do you measure quality, etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> Thanks for the reply. It surely gave me a head start. I will make sure to explain what exactly am I going to do in order to fulfill those points. <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span></p>
