<p>Hi,<br>
I'm Khawar — a Technical Writer from Pakistan with a degree in Technical Communication and interest in almost all sorts of documentation projects.<br>
I was going through the project idea of BRL-CAD for GSoD '21 and had a couple of questions regarding the scope of the current project.<br>
Also, I wanted to ask whether an alternate proposal (more focused on organizing the existing docs) will be considered this year?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="304346">@Khawar Latif Khan</span>, welcome to BRL-CAD.<br>
As far as I understood, you have to work on the proposed project. <strong>But</strong>, this projects description leaves some freedom on how you approach it. I.e., if you think that the documentation needs to be organized first....</p>
<p>How did you know about BRL-CADs GSoD project idea? The list of accepted organizations (with their proposals) will be published in 9 days? I've only a vague idea about its contents.</p>

<p>Oh yeah. That makes sense. I was working on drafting a statement of interest for BRL-CAD, so I thought I'd ask.</p>
<p>I'd been following BRL-CAD's GSoD project ideas since last year. The documentation is so extensive that there's a lot of room for improvement (which is always exciting).</p>

<p>I'm actually not sure if you can or cannot propose an alternate topic or alter the proposed project significantly.  I know many orgs still submitted a buffer of project ideas despite the application process wanting us to single out a project so it's more like a job / work-for-hire project description.</p>

<p>If the rules allow it, I wouldn't object to modifying the goals or approach, but that would need to be verified.  I think the one aspect that cannot change (or at least cannot increase) would be the amount of compensation.</p>
