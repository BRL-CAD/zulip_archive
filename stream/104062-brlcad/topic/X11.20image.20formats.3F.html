<p>Does anybody know anything about X11 image storage (specifically, their 32 bit RGBA formats?)  I'm trying to display buffer output from <a href="https://github.com/starseeker/tinygl">https://github.com/starseeker/tinygl</a> in a Tk_Photo buffer, but even though Tk_Photo is internally a 32 bit RGBA and tinygl's triangle.c seems to also be producing a 32 bit RGBA (and successfully displaying it with SDL) reading the same buffer into Tk_Photo doesn't produce the same image.</p>
<p>Tinygl was originally written to produce data for an X11 display, so presumably it's their formats that are at play here, but I'm having a hard time sorting out how to translate what's there into something that can be more generally viewed.</p>
<p>Does anybody know of any good resources for this sort of thing?</p>
