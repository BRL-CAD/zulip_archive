<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> Now that we have bext, I'm wondering if it might be worth tossing in a couple minimalist editors to restore the old idea of ensuring we can always edit a text file.  It looks as if the openbsd guys have cleaned up a small public domain emacs-alike editor which should handle most platforms other than Windows (<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/mg">https://github.com/troglobit/mg</a>).  For Windows it looks like someone has recreated something similar to edit.exe under MIT license:  <a href="https://github.com/malxau/yori">https://github.com/malxau/yori</a></p>

<p>Just to note result of discussion elsewhere - for the moment will place in the main repo (misc/tools) to try them out, since they are small.  Theory is that will be less clutter if we end up pulling them out again than adding bext dependency repos (which couldn't get pulled out without breaking history.)</p>
<p>As a general note, shouldn't put things in misc/tools over bext without discussing first - particularly if the source code in question is large.  Also, on the bext side of things, it's good practice to experiment with dependencies in a fork or branch first before committing them to the main history.  Once they're in main we can't delete them without breaking history.</p>
<p>We do have a lot of projects present in bext, but to date they are all either direct dependencies being staged for BRL-CAD features or dependencies of those dependencies (or build tools like astyle.)  Appearances aside, bext isn't actually intended to be a catch-all for anything that <em>might</em> be of interest.</p>
