<p>I'm getting  "error: ‘snprintf’ output may be truncated before the last format character" while running make. I know these are warnings that are being treated as errors and i can probably turn that flag off but this shouldn't be happening right?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198962">@Mayank Madan</span> It looks like this warning/error was introduced with gcc 7. You shoud be able to work around this issue by running <code>cmake</code> with the <code>-DBRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT=NO</code> parameter.</p>

<p>Okay so I've been playing around with MGED(trying to see how the commands are actually working behind the scenes) but i dont know how to proceed further. Is there a bug tracker? I dont know if the "BUGS" file in the repository is up to date</p>

<p>I could reproduce this behavior here. The program doesn't recognize that all windows were closed.</p>
<p>However, this behavior didn't got attention yet because this isn't the usual way to close the program. People either use File-&gt;Exit from the menu or (the usual way) type quit in the command window.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198962">@Mayank Madan</span> Not all, it relies on some system libraries, which may not be present if you have a newer operating system as the BRL-CAD binaries expect, for example. In the error you reported a libpng version 1.2 is missing. The current version is 1.6.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span>  Yes that's true but shouldn't there be some script that checks if all the libraries are present and if not, it gets  them for you? I know that it will be distribution dependant but still</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I hope you all are doing good and most importantly safe.</p>
<p>I am aiming for participating in this year's Google Season Of Docs and can't wait to help developing documentation.</p>
<p>I really liked this organization and went thoroughly through the website, documentation, and Github and it seems like I am really interested in contributing to this throughout the period of GSoD as well as later too.<br>
.<br>
I am eager to start working on it and would like to share my proposal statement of interest with you in a couple of days. As a part of it, I am really interested to get started on the development of documentation and eager to have some inputs from your side for a kickstart if there are some important points to consider.</p>
<p>Also, I hope I am not too late (primarily because of university end-semester exams) and have the slot still open for applying. It would be great to confirm from your side before any miscommunication.</p>
<p>If eligible, I would like to share my resume and some other links/samples for your reference. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Thanking You.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Yash R Patel</p>

<p>Howdy. I'm Jared McLaughlin. I'm a machinist by trade. </p>
<p>I am going to university to pursue a degree in Computer Science because I want to improve the state of the art in machining, and I think software is where we can make the biggest strides. </p>
<p>Therefore, I'm interested in learning the internals of different CAD and CAM systems. Basic algorithms, etc. </p>
<p>A lot of my interest is around STEP AP242 and AP238. I've got BRL-CAD downloaded and compiled, and I'm poking at the code base right now.</p>
<p>Jared</p>

<p>Thanks, Erik. I'm not great at programming, yet, but I think that there's a lot that can be done around machining. I never played with one of the 3018 machines. The smallest thing I've run is a Tormach 1100 and the biggest is some G&amp;L floor model horiztonal boring mill. I do have a Unimat 3 someone gave me that I'm tempted to turn in to a bar feed cnc lathe.</p>

<p>that is, no brep, no nurbs... closest for importing step would be to either limit the conversion to polygonal mesh step files (ugh) which are somewhat rare, or tessellating brep/nurbs (which would likely entail something in brl-cad, as we can do that)</p>

<p>But I (maybe naively) feel like it's not unreasonable to convert BREP to the distance fields IMplicitCAD uses. It _seems_ like it'd be similar to BREP -&gt; CSG in some ways.</p>

<p>BRL-CAD has 5 or so formal built-in operators, a dozen or more "external" operators, and about 24 formal entity types (including 4-5 that are "advanced" or explicit).  I think ImplicitCAD has about 15 formal operators and about 8 formal entity types (with 1 explicit).</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="475873">@Prajit Sengupta</span>, you should start with installing BRL-CAD. You can find the necessary installation packages at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/</a> This will install over 200 programs. Most of them are small command line tools. The most interesting for you are our old but still heavily used GUI mged and the more modern GUI archer.

<p>Additional resources could be <a href="https://brlcad.org/wiki/NURBS">https://brlcad.org/wiki/NURBS</a> and the links provided there.</p>
<p>As described on GitHub, BRL-CAD utilizes the openNURBS library. The code, which implements the interface, can be found in <a href="https://brlcad.org/wiki/NURBS">src/libbrep</a>. The BRL-CAD primitive name for openNURBS entities is <strong>brep</strong> (short for boundary representation).</p>
<p>A possible outcome for the NURBS editing support project would be a mged command <code>in nurbs.s brep ...</code>, where <strong>...</strong> (i.e. a reasonable combination of keywords and numbers) creates a cube in openNURBS, for example.</p>

I am Shyam Sunder, I am a 4th year UG student from BITS Pilani Goa Campus.<br>
I have professional experience with python and javascript as a full-stack developer for a startup internship. I have worked with ReactJs for frontend applications, I believe my experience with building modern UI for new-age startups can help me contribute to the new GUI for BRL-CAD.<br>
I have read the idea on the idea list, and I have a few questions for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> -</p>
<ol>

<li>Can I also get an overview of the arbalest repo?</li>
<li>Will suggesting missing features picked from the UI sketches linked along with the idea suffice for this project? </li>
</ol>
<p>I have been improving my familiarity with c++ and would love to improve my proficiency from intermediate to expert during this project.<br>
Also, any suggestions for the proposal for this project is appreciated.</p>

<p>Welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="593744">@VR Shyam Sunder</span> !  Our GUI efforts are based in Qt C/C++, so hopefully that's something you have some experience with or can learn quickly.</p>
<p>As for your questions -- for q#1, you define the project.  So whether it involves the arbalest repo or something else will be somewhat up to you and what you want to do.  As for our needs, working on the arbalest project is certainly one of the priority ways for getting involved.  There's also a code called 'qged' in the 'brlcad' repo that uses Qt that would benefit moving closer to how arbalest is doing things with OOP.  There's also a geometry V&amp;V gui that was build on arbalest that could use more work and is sort of a middle ground between arbalest and qged at the moment.</p>
<p>For q#2, the best overview of the arbalest repo is the code itself.  It should be pretty self-explanatory as it adheres strongly to principles of encapsulation.  </p>
<p>For q#3, sure that can suffice, but you will want to describe and demonstrate more than what we wrote to show that you both understand the problem and that you have a plan for how you'd implement the objectives you define.</p>

<p>Welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="595864">@Varma Venkata Satyanarayana Datla</span> !  Feel free to also join Appleseed's Discord for discussion there if you like, but here is fine too.  Please create a new discussion thread for discussing here on Zulip.  Your best starting point is to install and run appleseed and then building and running from a source checkout.  Both are described at <a href="https://appleseedhq.net/docs/tutorials/gettingstarted.html">https://appleseedhq.net/docs/tutorials/gettingstarted.html</a></p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="593744">@VR Shyam Sunder</span>, because you seem to have more experience in web technologies than C++: How about the <a href="https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/26">Online Geometry Viewer (OGV)</a>? We haven't prioritized it for this years GSoC yet, but this is mainly because we are in doubt about its further developed. If someone can convince us of a good plan... Meteor is not a must.</p>

<p>Yes! the OGV project looks very interesting and also aligns with my skill set, this is the perfect project for me to contribute to, good to know that it uses meteor, I have a dabbled with it once.</p>
<p>I have tried to fork and run the app, I think I am facing an issue with the mail server settings in settings.json,  I'm not sure if I have to set up a server or if its a trivial issue, can I get help regarding this? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span> </p>
<p>Also, should I be making a proposal with the existing list of issues for the OGV meteor project? I see a lot of GSOC-2019 labels, a bit confused.</p>

<p>Hi, <br>
      Are you people looking for volunteers? I have a background in programming on and off for close to 40 years. But just got back into it heavily. I have an associate in computer aided drafting. Also, I’m 4 classes shy of a bachelor's degree in computer science. A friend of mine said that FreeCad and BRL-CAD were going to be combined.  I don’t know a lot about parametric model coding, but I am willing to learn. I'm not very familiar with BRL-CAD either, but I have messed around with it a little bit. I'm much more familiar with FreeCad so if you need help with this integration I could take a look and see if this is beyond my skillset or not.  I’m also rather weak in web coding but plan to spend my summer improving on that skill set. My strength is in coding things like micro-controllers and design. I’m familiar with programs like Eagle and KiCad although it has been several years. I worked as a technician for 12 years, and I can design circuit boards from the ground up. Although, I’d rather see features like the features in SolidWorks rather than electronics features in FreeCad. However, I know that some individuals are looking for those features. Not looking for a paid internship, just something to go into a portfolio as I’d like to become an independent software developer.</p>
<p>Reading what others have wrote, I'm also a little familiar with Blender. But probably more familiar with AutoCad products (Except Maya) and SolidWorks than anything else.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="618145">@Jeramee</span>, I would not call them to "going to be combined", but yes, there is the idea of having BRL-CAD as a back-end for FreeCAD: <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8557">https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8557</a></p>
<p>As a start, you should prepare your development environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build BRL-CAD</li>
<li>Build MOOSE</li>
<li>Build the MOOSE examples and arbalest to learn how to create applications using MOOSE</li>
<li>Build FreeCAD</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you can use <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=75828&amp;start=50#p669805">this</a> post as starting point. I says that replacing OpenCasCade with BRL-CAD in FreeCAD means to reimplement the Part library. I.e., you have to find out, how the interface of this library to the rest of FreeCAD looks like and how its behavior can be implemented with BRL-CAD. If you have questions regarding the BRL-CAD stuff, you can ask them here.</p>

<p>Welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="618145">@Jeramee</span> and absolutely!   There are many ways you can get involved.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sounds like your experience is ON POINT.  Glad to have you here.  Did you have any ideas on how you wanted to get involved or what you wanted to work on?  Lots of possibilities, but usually best to align with an itch you'd like to scratch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A friend of mine said that FreeCad and BRL-CAD were going to be combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hah!  Well, we worked together for years, but continued collaboration and code sharing is the only concrete goal at the moment.  They've talked about having a BRL-CAD workbench in FreeCAD like they have for OpenSCAD, but nobody is currently working on that -- so that's something you could certainly try tackling. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know a lot about parametric model coding, but I am willing to learn. I'm not very familiar with BRL-CAD either, but I have messed around with it a little bit.

</blockquote>
<p>I would probably suggest a simpler coding objective for starters, but really open to anything that excites you.  FreeCAD is mostly a parametric modeler (akin to Creo) whereas BRL-CAD is mostly a solid modeler (akin to NX, somewhat akin to Solidworks).  Understanding underlying geometry representations and the conversions needed and tradeoffs of the various representation schemes is a big piece of interoperability.</p>
<p>Your experience is entirely relevant and I definitely appreciate and will be happy to support you learning whatever you need to learn to make progress.  If you'd like some ideas on how to get involved, I can probably rattle off several ways from big to small.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Awesome, it looks like I&#39;ll be working with you guys. I preferred FreeCAD as the front-end is much more user friendly, IMHO. However, I think the only active group there is the GSOC, and I missed the boat on that one. I&#39;m afraid that I won&#39;t learn a lot about workflows there as they are either too busy, too inactive, or perhaps just a language barrier as many of the FreeCAD team are based in Europe. I can say this BRL-CAD provided responses that are more on point, and I believe that I&#39;ll learn a lot more about workflows form you people. I&#39;d like to start my own software dev company so learning these things that I won&#39;t learn in college is critical to my success. 
I&#39;m interested in things like creating a CNC cut sheet out of a part. I have some experience as a machinist and took some classes in G-code as well as MasterCam.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Is that something that would be easier to do with BRL-CAD or FreeCAD? </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>If the answer is FreeCAD, please answer honestly as I don&#39;t have any problems working on something else.
</code></pre></div>

<p>And I am looking for suggestions in that regard as I don't know nearly as much about BRL-CAD as FreeCAD.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Right now I am downloading training data and writing something in python to train OpenAI with Custom Data on coding parametric modeling, CAD, CAM, and CNC, etc. as well as pdf textbooks on the subject. I&#39;ll code something by hand at first before leveraging the AI to increase productivity. My two strongest languages are probably Python and C++ but I can code in just about anything.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Do you people use MOOSE for your workflow? </p>
<p>I think FreeCAD uses a Ruby build script for their workflow.<br>
I can build all this stuff. Might even start today. Almost sure I've built FreeCAD on MacOS via Homebrew as they didn't have a stand alone for my version of Mac at the time. I use Windows now because of better CAD support, but used Mac and Linux for many years so I can help with Linux builds for sure. (No working Mac, atm.)</p>
<p>Can we pin something for Dev questions and workflows?</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I am RaghavJit from India. I am in 3rd year of my Computer Science and Engineering course at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana.</p>
<p>I am more comfortable with Linux (Ubuntu), would you recommend using linux to clone &gt; build &gt; run BRL CAD? Or should I stick with Windows? I am doing this to get familiar with the codebase.</p>

<li>Go through the mged tutorial <a href="https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>. The tutorial will show you how to create geometries, assign materials, create ray-trace images, and many more.</li>

<p>Hey guys, <br>
I am Abhiram a sophomore at NITT, My primary domain is devOps, other than that I mainly work in backend, cybersecurity, and Blockchain. I really like the philosophy behind open source and decentralization but due to prior commitments I was not able to work on them during my first year but now I have been active in the open source community for the past 7 to 8 months, other than that right now I am actively working with my club to improve my collage tech infrastructure and building a project for a startup that's being incubated by NTU Singapore. <br>
I am quite interested in working KiCad issue: KiCad to ODB++ exporter and the OpenSCAD issue: OpenSCAD Font Selector Window with preview and search functionality, Any advice regarding this would be helpful, and thanks a lot.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="697458">@Tejaswee Sulekh</span> thank you for that introduction and for your interest in helping to develop PBR support.  It's a challenging but very fun effort with excellent visual results.  To get started, you'll want to learn as much as you can about physically-based rendering and where that support is in BRL-CAD.  You'll want to compile BRL-CAD with Appleseed enabled, which can be quite tricky to get working in itself, which will make an "art" executable that this project is all about getting working better by default.  If you get stuck, you can start by building BRL-CAD without Appleseed enabled (look at the cmake output to know if it's on or off) and learn the basics of converting and rendering a piece of geometry on the command-line.  You can also independently download Appleseed and learn how to use its raytracer to convert and render a piece of geometry.  That's all necessary background that "should" just take an hour or two, but can take days if you get stuck.  Feel free to ask follow- up questions in a "PBR" thread under <a class="stream" data-stream-id="111975" href="/#narrow/stream/111975-Google-Summer-of-Code">#Google Summer of Code</a></p>

<p>Hi everyone, I am a computer science undergrad at UESTC. I have hands-on experience in real-time rendering, including ray tracing, and shader development from my internship as a technical artist at a game studio. I also explored graphics research about Gaussian splatting. I am excited to apply my background to contribute to BRL-CAD, especially in areas involving GPU-based ray tracing or novel visualization features. I look forward to discussing potential project ideas and collaborating with you all!</p>

<p>welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="892744">@Kanchan Borole</span> .. you'll want to get familiarized with where that project current sits implemented, get it compiled if you can, read the provided report documentation, and propose work</p>

<p>you'll also want to work on some code change, but that can be to literally any code in BRL-CAD so long as it's some meaningful improvement, not just a change for the sake of making a change.</p>

<p>Hi @Sean, <br>
Thanks for welcome and the information on getting started with the "Geometric Verification and Validation GUI in Qt(AI project)". I have started looking into the project documentation and the current implementation to get a better understanding. I am planning to set up the development environment to compile the project.</p>
<p>I am eager to contribute and will be exploring the codebase to identify areas where I can make meaningful improvements, as you suggested. I will keep you updated on my progress and any specific areas where I think I can contribute effectively.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Kanchan Borole</p>
