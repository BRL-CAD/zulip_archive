<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252475">@Himanshu Sekhar Nayak</span>  sir,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well! My name is Adnaan, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>I'm reaching out to express my genuine interest in your project. Having delved into various technologies, my tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Your project seems like an exciting opportunity for me to apply my skills and learn more in the process.</p>
<p>I'm keen to start contributing to your project and making a meaningful impact. Could you please guide me on how I can get started and become a valuable member of your team?</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm also interested in participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. Could you provide any insights or advice on how to prepare for and potentially participate in GSoC?</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Adnaan</p>
