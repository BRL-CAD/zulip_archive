<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252475">@Himanshu Sekhar Nayak</span>  sir,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well! My name is Adnaan, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>I'm reaching out to express my genuine interest in your project. Having delved into various technologies, my tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Your project seems like an exciting opportunity for me to apply my skills and learn more in the process.</p>
<p>I'm keen to start contributing to your project and making a meaningful impact. Could you please guide me on how I can get started and become a valuable member of your team?</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm also interested in participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. Could you provide any insights or advice on how to prepare for and potentially participate in GSoC?</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Adnaan</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252475">@Himanshu</span>  Sir <br>
I’m Divy Singhvi, an engineering student at the College of Technology and Engineering, Udaipur. I’m genuinely interested in the BRL-CAD modeling system and would love to contribute to the project. I’m also a GSoC 2025 enthusiast and have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Node.js, LLMs, and C++. I’m eager to learn whatever is necessary to contribute effectively. Looking forward to your response</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="759930">@Divy singhvi</span>, did you installed BRL-CAD? You can find the necessary installation packages at <a href="https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases</a>. This will install over 200 programs. Most of them are small command line tools. The most interesting for you are our old but still heavily used GUI mged and the more modern GUI archer. Go through the mged tutorial <a href="https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href="https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.</p>
<p>To start programming, download the source code from <a href="https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a>, compile, and install the programs (<a href="https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span> i have installed BRL-CAD on my system and started going through the mged tutorials, but i am more interested on the programming aspect, downloaded the source code and both of the <a href="https://brlcad.org/wiki/">https://brlcad.org/wiki/</a> links are not working?</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="759930">@Divy singhvi</span>, we're currently migrating to a new server so it will take some time for the wiki to be up. Welcome to our organization. If you're going to build brlcad in windows then just download the repo from github and install cmake, visual studio. Open cmake and provide src path and build path. Hit configure button 2 times then hit generate button. Then open the project. After opening, you can build it by opening cmake predefined targets and you will see <code>ALL_BUILD</code>. Then start building it.</p>
