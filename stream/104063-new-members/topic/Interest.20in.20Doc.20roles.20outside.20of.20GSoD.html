<p>How many of you are interested in taking on a documentation project regardless of GSoD?  We have a number of leadership roles and projects that can be assigned if people are interested in helping improve BRL-CAD and they don't get selected.  We can only accept one person into the GSoD program for the paid position, but I'm more than willing to mentor anyone that is interested regardless.</p>

<p>It may be too late for purposes of being included in the SoCiS list of students, but it's never too late to simply work on a project.  I can ask the ESA after you have a project selected and minimal plan written.</p>

<p>That sounds great, yes.  Just be sure you check out Ankesh's 2014 project.  He made phenomenal progress, but never completely "finished".  I believe the latest state of the code is in our github repo, but you'll want to check and maybe check his bitbucket repo too.</p>

<p>That sounds great, yes.  Just be sure you check out Ankesh's 2014 project.  He made phenomenal progress, but never completely "finished".  I believe the latest state of the code is in our github repo, but you'll want to check and maybe check his bitbucket repo too.</p>

<p>I had seen Ankesh's project log. will go through the project code from the github and bitbucket repo. <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>

<p>When i was Installing the project i came across two errors.</p>
<p>1. django was not able to load atomic module, the reason been that atomic module is supported from django 1.6 and in the requirement files django 1.5 was specified. to solve this I changed the requirement to 1.6.<br>
2. After carrying out the first change, i came across second error "cannot import name execute_manager"  after doing some stack poping(stackoverflow). I came across on answer, which says that execute manager is deprecated from django version 1.4 and is been completely removed from 1.6<br>
The answer also suggested that as the manage.py file itself is not compatible with 1.6 so is your project.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> what do you suggest?</p>
<p>As we are further developing the project should i make the project compatible to the most stable django version available or make the change back in the requirement file(i.e required django version is downgraded to 1.5 ) and then try to replace the atomic module with some similar module which would offer the same functionality.</p>
<p>Screenshot with the second bug and the stack answer.<br>
