<p>Hello everyone! I'm Arslan from Pakistan writing this. After i heard about GSoD i went through organization details and got to know about BRL-CAD. I myself am a mechanical engineer and have experience in CAD modelling. In fact it's my hobby to learn new CAD software so i am absolutely super excited for working for BRL-CAD. My other hobbies are book reading and writing. What about you guys??</p>

<p>Greetings everyone!!!<br>
I am Kartikey Joshi from India, currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering. When I came to know about GSoD through my friend, I was excited about it as I love writing in my past time. I have also worked as technical writer with <a href="http://geekeasier.com" target="_blank" title="http://geekeasier.com">geekeasier.com</a> . Then my interest grew in designing and solid modeling. I have working knowledge of three different CAD softwares. And now I am involved in learning Robotics. I love to design Robots and currently working to design a smaller version of Industrial Robot.<br>
Seeing a CAD organisation in GSoD has made me super enthusiastic to work here. I am new to open source. And in the past few days I have gone through the documentation of BRL - CAD and I am thinking of organising the existing documentation as my project for GSoD. Please guide me towards the next step.<br>
Thank You<span aria-label="smiley" class="emoji emoji-1f603" role="img" title="smiley">:smiley:</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222399">@Muhammad Arslan</span>  You'll want to focus your proposal on just one topic.  There's definitely not time to do both well.  The harder projects are preferred over the easier ones, but do not propose something you are not fully capable of working hard and delivering on (or you'll essentially disqualify yourself if we think you don't have enough technical experience).  You'll want to have a detailed proposal.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="211316">@Chetan Shinde</span> Congratulations on your report.  It looks nice.  I like the integrated diagrams and overall layout.  </p>
<p>If you're looking for suggestions on making it better, I would offer just a couple points of advice -- one would be to follow a particular style guide, which you may have been doing already.  That usually helps with consistency and norms for readers.  For example, using Latin numerals is usually reserved for preambles in books and reports, not for the main body.  Not a big deal, but it starts to get important when document pages get into the dozens or hundreds of pages.  Another point would be to have the grammar checked by a second set of eyes.  I noticed a couple phrasing issues in the document, none major but they were enough to distract from the content in places.  Otherwise, I think the use of LaTeX is perfect for this kind of report and that's exactly what it was made for.  The layout looks really nice.</p>

<p>Our documentation system is in Docbook XML for the time being.  At least, that's the required format until someone works on the Documentation Infrastructure project which would shift us to using Markdown or Asciidoc, depending on the doc system.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="211316">Chetan Shinde</span> Congratulations on your report.  It looks nice.  I like the integrated diagrams and overall layout.  </p>
<p>If you're looking for suggestions on making it better, I would offer just a couple points of advice -- one would be to follow a particular style guide, which you may have been doing already.  That usually helps with consistency and norms for readers.  For example, using Latin numerals is usually reserved for preambles in books and reports, not for the main body.  Not a big deal, but it starts to get important when document pages get into the dozens or hundreds of pages.  Another point would be to have the grammar checked by a second set of eyes.  I noticed a couple phrasing issues in the document, none major but they were enough to distract from the content in places.  Otherwise, I think the use of LaTeX is perfect for this kind of report and that's exactly what it was made for.  The layout looks really nice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Sean! for your valuable inputs. Will keep all these points in mind.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="224627">@Ebenezer Graham</span> !  Glad to see you found zulipchat.  You haven't yet found the main BRL-CAD doc sources, though -- you found our other Github repos.  The docs are in our main repo which is still in Subversion on SourceForge: <a href="http://brlcad.org/wiki/Building_from_SVN" target="_blank" title="http://brlcad.org/wiki/Building_from_SVN">http://brlcad.org/wiki/Building_from_SVN</a></p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm Yida from TUM, a Ph.D. student working on 3D vision tasks, willing to join GSoD this year. Two of my most recent publications in IEEE 3D Vision and IEEE TIPcould be found in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yida_Wang/research" target="_blank" title="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yida_Wang/research">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yida_Wang/research</a>. I think that I'm good to work with "writing a 'BRL-CAD Primitives' manual and organize developer docs" proposal.</p>
<p>Additionally, a video is also released on my personal website <a href="https://wangyida.github.io/publication/3dv18_wang/" target="_blank" title="https://wangyida.github.io/publication/3dv18_wang/">https://wangyida.github.io/publication/3dv18_wang/</a> for 3D scene understanding topics. Apart from writing professional documents for BRL-CAD’s GSoD this year, I’m also interested to build a fancy website for BRL-CAD based on the similar framework as what I am using for my current 3D vision research <a href="https://wangyida.github.io/" target="_blank" title="https://wangyida.github.io/">https://wangyida.github.io/</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225944">@Yida Wang</span>!  Thanks for the introduction and glad to see you're involved.  It's probably also worth mentioning that you've been a GSoC student twice in the past as well, correct?</p>

<p>Hi Sean, yes I have spent two years with OpenCV for vision based deep learning projects which are supported by GSoC. And now I also mentor other student for coding with GSoC</p>

<p>This is actually the first year of GSoD right? Rather similar to my paper writing experience. Previously I prepare all documents for open source organizations using Doxygen.</p>

<p>This is the first year of GSoD, so there's a lot of discovery going on.  Seeing what will work and what won't.  As one of the oldest participating orgs, we know GSoC very well.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> I have been able to checkout the base repository and started initialized docusaurus in the doc directory. I want to explore how the validation will be done to keep the documentation in sync. Can you share your ideas on this? Also, I noticed that the wiki site is down. I would like to explore more and understand the BRL-CAD better. </p>
<p>In addition, I have submitted my application for the project. I will share my proposal for review and feedback.</p>
