<p>Thank you to all of you that have been working on a GSoC application!  Please continue to talk with others here, on IRC, on our mailing list, whatever works so that you're interacting with others.  There's nothing you have to do except wait until Google announces selections.   (i.e., we don't announce and can't tell you, so don't ask... and yes, it can be a long nerve-wrecking time to wait.)</p>
<p>If you don't want to wait and/or want to improve your chances of getting selected, the best thing you can do now is to be <strong>usefully productive</strong> by submitting a code patch or pull request (or more if you have already).  It doesn't guarantee anything, but it lets us know so much more about you than you proposal and it indicates commitment.  It also doesn't have to be related to your project, but is ideally something that demonstrates your ability to read and modify existing code (BUGS and TODO items are typically perfect).  Code patches are typically the main deciding factor after a complete proposal.</p>

<p>That's certainly some of them <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="109577">@Jaipal Singh</span> .  There's also the top-level BUGS file and TODO files in various subdirs for specific libraries.</p>
