<p>Hi, I'm Ronan Coutinho,  a second year student pursuing BTech in Computer Science Engineering from BITS Pilani, India. I came across your GSOC 2024 Project Idea based on implementing bindings for the BRL-CAD functionality to Python language. I have a strong foundation of Python language as I have used it in previous projects. I am new to open source contributions but am eager to learn. Please  guide me as to how I should get started and be able to contribute to this project.</p>

<p>An important point of the Python binding topic is the design of the API. You should learn about the currently available APIs (basic C API, TCL script, object oriented MOOSE), how they give the user access to BRL-CAD's features, and develop a concept for a Python interface.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="693398">@Ronan Coutinho</span> welcome!  There is a lot to learn on the python bindings topic, but you're welcome to propose whatever you think sounds like a great project idea, tailored to your knowledge.  Do know that there has been some work in the past on python bindings for BRL-CAD that might be worth looking into.  You don't have to use them, or you can build off what they did and take things further -- you propose what you want to do.  Here's some links to related efforts:</p>

<p>It should be <code>brlcad\Debug\</code> if you are in windows.</p>

<p>Hmm, you are on Windows, therefore the path should probably start with <code>C:\</code>. Where is your BRL-CAD installation? In addition, I'm in doubt that the python-brlcad will work with a current BRL-CAD version.</p>

<p>Glad to hear it <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="693398">@Ronan Coutinho</span>   feel free to ask follow-up questions as you learn.  I certainly have my biases of what I'd like to see and am happy to share those thoughts with you sometime, but any proposal should be meaningful to you first. </p>
<p>It will help to compile BRL-CAD from source, and do one of the simple tutorials just so you get some familiarity.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="693398">@Ronan Coutinho</span> as I mentioned, that previous work was developed several years ago now so the scripts are going to be out of date.  Per the error message, it's saying "ctypesgen-dev" doesn't exist, which is not hard to imagine given how much time has passed.  It's possible it's just renamed, maybe "ctypesgen" or something similar, or it's possible that entire code path was replaced with a different mechanism.  A quick search indicates ctypesgen is still around, so probably just a matter of finding the right name.  That said, there are going to be changes needed to get the previous walkthrough working.  That's part of the effort for that project -- to figure that all out.. ;)</p>

<p>Sounds good to me. What do you mean in your 4th point? I didn't understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I meant if any new primitive is being developed right now I could work on wrapping that as well. Or are the current primitives the only ones that would exist.</p>

<p>1.Looking at the previous work done in this project most of the primitives have been wrapped in python-brlcad. I will complete the remaining, which are rcc, tec, trc, ellg  1, part, ars, spline , binunif. With tests and examples.<br>
2.Apart from this I also want to update the install scripts for python brlcad and bring it upto date. A problem which I'm facing myself :)<br>
3.Current version depends on Python 2.7x.  I could extend support to python 3</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Creation of primitives based on feedback from community.<br>
These are the deliverables in my mind as of now. Please share your feedback and anything else you'd like to see in this project.</li>

<li>sounds good.  ars could probably be ignored, but it would be nice from a completeness standpoint to have a full mapping for all entities.</li>
<li>seems reasonable.</li>
<li>anything new should be python 3...</li>
<li>you should compare the list of primitives to what we have.  I didn't see mention of brep, for example, or pnts, I'm sure there are others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on how the schedule works out, I think the importance here would be making it really simple with examples, well documented, as easy as absolutely possible to use on all platforms (mac, linux, windows), and proving that it works somehow -- perhaps by way of test cases (CI/CD).</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="703011">@Sakthi N</span>, to make your proposal to be taken into consideration, you would have to be more active here, discuss your project with the potential mentors - and provide at least one patch.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span> , I shall be active in this chat in the upcoming days. I already have Python and MinGW. I shall install BRL CAD, go through other documentation on the github page, and get started.</p>
