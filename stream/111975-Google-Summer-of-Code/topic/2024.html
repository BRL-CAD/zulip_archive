<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="*">@all</span> !  There was a great Google kick-off meeting last week for admins and mentors that I know at least <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span> and I were at, maybe others as well.  This is going to be the 20th year of the program!  I'm going to send the usual call-for-mentors e-mail out here in a bit, but there's at least one topic that might be good to discuss more fluidly, namely how our project ideas are presented.</p>
<p>This was one of the topics discussed at the kick-off meeting that had me reflecting on the challenges we've had the past couple years attracting student proposals across all partner orgs.   Google specifically called out not just pointing candidates at an issue tracker -- unless we really tailor it to the program, which we do, but the underlying point remains about making the list more reader-friendly and scannable.  To address that, I'm wondering how much work it would be to "publish" the combined list to a single page? </p>
<p>We also need to balance the number of topic ideas so that there's 1-3 ideas per mentor, namely that there's a specific mentor behind the proposed idea and that mentor is specifically (and contemporaneously) advocating for that project idea, not just a big list of things needed in the past that we'll find a mentor for if we get a good proposal.</p>
<p>The end goal for our ideas list, assuming a goal of 6-8 slots, would be an ideas list with about 20-25 ideas total, ideally randomly presented on each view, with titles and summary descriptions curated to be easily understood (and then perhaps linking to the issue page with more details).</p>

<p>If you are interested in mentoring this year, please do indicate interest here (include name and which partner-org) or on the mailing list so we can get a rough head-count and list of partner-orgs.</p>

<p>I think the dedicated issue list with tag filtering is actually quite good and would take a big amount of work trying to host that as separate application. What we might be able to do without too big of additional effort is extracting that issue data into a file and using that for backing a single web page.<br>
That would let us keep all the maintenance UI via github issues and also the link to those filters, while giving a better entry page than the currently very static one while keeping that part simple as it's view-only.</p>

<p>I'm interested in helping with BRL-CAD. I found a little node utility that pulls the issues down as CSV at <a href="https://github.com/gavinr/github-csv-tools">https://github.com/gavinr/github-csv-tools</a> , the only complication I see with that side of it is that  the body is in markdown. I think it'd be pretty trivial to read the CSV and print a static webpage (then cron it or whatever), mostly just deciding on presentation. Randomizing per view would be a bit more involved, needing some kinda code somehow to generate a dynamic view.</p>

<p>Fetching the github issue list as JSON and presenting that (ignoring the markdown for now, but that should be possible too via the highlight library I believe) is not that complicated.</p>
<p>For testing I've created a repository for the site generator at <a href="https://github.com/opencax/project-proposals">https://github.com/opencax/project-proposals</a> which deploys to <a href="https://opencax.github.io/project-proposals/">https://opencax.github.io/project-proposals/</a> - Question is now what to present and how.</p>

<p>I'm perfectly fine with mentors attaching themselves to the projects they wish to mentor, and it's okay if there is overlap.  We typically strive for a 2:1 mentor to contributor ratio if possible anyways, but 1:1 is also okay.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share that the 2024 application was submitted and the new project-proposals page is what was used for our project ideas page.  It looks really great!  That also means it's time to confirm mentoring and finalize/update project descriptions.</p>
<p>For all mentoring, please check over the list of projects and make sure your name is on at least one of the topics.  Make sure that topic has a very clear title, and any extra details can go into the description.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="702819">@Matteo Balice</span> for submitting a code change that goes with your proposal, generally speaking one is required.  Any code change is better than no code change, however small.   Code changes that actually fix a bug or are a feature improvement are best.  Code changes that are a fix or an improvement and also relates to your proposal are a bonus.</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds of potential ideas in the top-level source repository's BUGS and TODO files of vaying complexity.  There are also various FIXME notes throughout the codebase that you'll come across reading code.  There are also issues on GitHub.  You're also welcome to simply run one of the tools, discover something that could be fixed/improved, and work on that.</p>
<p>It's a very large system, so the possibilities are practically endless.  Part of the task is assessing your ability to navigate code and talk with other developers.</p>

<p>Thank you to all our applicants and congratulations to our four selected BRL-CAD contributors, and five other umbrella participants.  You all made the selection process difficult with such variety and quality of proposals.  It was definitely a challenging process, but kudos to those selected for your efforts communicating with mentors, working on code contribution(s), and of course for your proposal writeups.  Looking forward to working with you.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span>  Thanks for the opportunity. I noticed that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="700180">@fall Rainy</span> was also accepted for the same research project of neural rendering as mine. Was the idea for us to collaborate? If so, I think it would be even better, and it would probably lead to better results. I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="702819">@Matteo Balice</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="700180">@fall Rainy</span> , the idea is not to collaborate as GSoC projects must be independent but I did want to talk to you both about your options.  I was actually just starting to articulate my thoughts in an e-mail which I hope to send here in a bit -- keep an eye out for it.</p>

<p>Thanks! I will continue to follow this conference, especially the "NeRFs and Lighting" sections. Regarding collaboration, I have an idea:<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="702819">@Matteo Balice</span>  and I can approach the project in different ways. For the sampling method, he will use the "bounding sphere method," while I will use the "boundary-based active learning approach." In terms of network design, he will employ various methods to improve the network, whereas I will design an entirely new network, with one possible option being the KAN network. We can maintain consistency across various interfaces, which will facilitate communication and help us find the best solutions.</p>
