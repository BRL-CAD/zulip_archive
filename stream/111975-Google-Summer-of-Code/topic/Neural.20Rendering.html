<p>Hi Sean, Thanks for the message. </p>
<p><strong>About my background:</strong> I come from a geometric vision background where I worked more than 6 years, to go along with my masters in robotics from Northwestern.  I have developed solutions to problems like Stereo visual Odometry, Depth data based SLAM / TSDF fusion of depth maps into a volumetric volume to generate geometry, Extrinsic sensor calibration algorithms (the act of optimizing solutions to where sensors are located). I have done a few deep learning works as well like deep reinforcement policy  learning for a knot tieing, weed localization and human character recgonition. I can send you my resume to any mail id of interest, if you want to know about my background further. Though I don't actively have a graphics background, I do understand the broader details and am able to grasp quickly to execute ideas. My programming languages of comfort are C++ and python (though I do think I can pick up any language within a reasonable time)</p>
<p><strong>About the work</strong>: I did spent a few hours trying to understand the work. Here is my summary - A classic ray tracing pipeline on BVH for rendering objects is slow. One of the deep learning ways to speed this up is to  train a MLP to be a neural intersection function - a network that primarily predicts occupancy as a probability (0-1), but it can be trained to predict other properties as well like shading /  reflectence. This network can be trained directly on position and ray directions, but it does not practically work well. So, the solution is to learn some feature embeddings for position and direction, which then feed into MLP. Each of position and direction are points in R^3, but this leads to ray duplicates, so they can be compactly represented as points in R^2, by using spherical co-ordinates and substituting the ray origin with ray intersection. Raycasting is usually done in multi bounces, where secondary rays are traced from the primary ray. So there are two NIFs one (outer NIF) predicting the primary intersection, and the other (inner NIF) predicting occupancy from the secondary intersection. The inner NIF takes ray distance embedding as input in addition to position and direction embeddings. It seems like a classic tracing tracing scheme employs two hierarchies in BVH to trace rays. The top BVH tracing is cheap while the bottom BVH tracking is expensive. NIFs replace the bottom BVH part, while the top BVH tracing is done through classical means. The outer NIF just predicts occupancy while the inner NIF predicts other properties in addition to occupancy.</p>
<p><strong>Some open questions I am still trying to find answers to</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the feature embedding scheme for position and direction? I know that sine and cosine bases (fourier analysis motivated) is used a lot in works like nerfs, but I have not got to the bottom of what embedding is used here</li>
<li>It seems like the networks used here are AMD specific C++ libraries. Is this something that we will use in this work? Or is the idea to use a more popular library like pytorch.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My personal motivation for taking this work</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I have never contributed to open source and I was scouting for places to begin my open source journey. Contributing to open source increases my visibility and exposes me to learn a lot more than from just contributing to the private repos that I work for.</li>
<li>I want to work on a geometric deep learning project to update myself to the SOTA</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="694938">@Senthil Palanisamy</span> Thank you for the excellent introduction.  From your background, it sounds like you could probably propose a couple different projects that would align with needs (like a slam-based object reconstruction using ray tracing), which is all outstanding background for working on neural rendering.  Obviously a lot of related concepts.  As for your resume, you can just submit that when you submit a proposal (which you can/should do early and then continuously update, whenever it opens).  Given the nature of GSoC, resume's and the project write-up itself are only a small fraction of selection criteria.  It's communication that matters most (both here and via code).</p>
<p>I think your understanding of the project is right on track and you did a great job summarizing AMD's work.  They essentially showed that it can be faster, so now my question is whether it can be faster and more generally applicable for a set of conditions like expensive geometries and reasonably precise hit points. Can we actually use it as an acceleration structure in practice, or is the training phase entirely impractical; what sort of net is needed to capture all the necessary detail; is the two-layer network adequate; are the two NIFs actually necessary; ... lots of open questions many of which are hand-waved in the paper and proved challenging in our previous investigations by a team at TAMU.</p>
<p>As to your questions, if I'm understanding you correctly, then 1) is really just a dimensionality reduction so lookups can be fast and fewer parameters in the latent space are needed for encoding.  Instead of using 6 float/double values for the input layer (xyz pos + ijk dir), they use 4 float values (az/el pos + az/el dir).  There may be more nuance implied for feature embedding, though, so there may be work needed to understand it if changes are to be made.  I'm a little surprised I didn't see residual linkages, and that they got away with such simple topology, but then we have yet to reproduce  their results either. As for 2) the did rely on libs for performance and they certainly can be used but they're not a focus or requirement.  The fundamental question is is this approach even feasible as an acceleration approach to represent a given geometry model.  That has both elements of accuracy and performance, but can be proven without making it production-ready.  Libs like pytorch can certainly be used.  In fact, the previous team fully bridged from C to Py to C during ray-tracing which was of course painfully slow, but they weren't successful in getting accurate hit points so the question is still an open one.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. The grid look up makes sense now. I was intially under the misunderstanding that some network converts position, direction -&gt; position, direction embedding. But it does make sense that it is just a grid that is trained as well in the training process. I have a few follow up questions</p>
<ol>
<li>What kind of training practically are we talking of? Since this is a CAD product, is the idea that the network has to train real time as the user possibly edits the model to update the rendering in real time? Or is the idea the training can be done once, in a somewhat offline fashion (like a few minutes or few 10s of minutes) and then can be used for rendering (where the user is assumed to not edit)</li>
<li>As for the implementation is concerned, the network itself looks simple and innocuous, each NIF is a MLP - the outer is a 2 layer MLP with 64 units in each layer, while the inner NIF is a two layer MLP with 48 units in each layer, I am just trying to get my head around how the training data is generated and from what sources,  to set up this training problem. I should be able to code this up once I figure out the training data.</li>
<li>You mentioned something about another project - "slam-based object reconstruction using ray tracing", Can you point me to any thread or resources to understand this better? I would love to know details about this.</li>

<p>It's not really a grid lookup.  It's just a different way to express a vector.  For the neural net, it's less input data and thus less latent space nodes are needed to encode.  It's still just a vector though, a clever optimization.  We even coincidentally have an image depicting both (the vector can point outwards or inwards): <a href="https://brlcad.org/gallery/picture.php?/4">https://brlcad.org/gallery/picture.php?/4</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The latter. A given model will get "baked" such that a NN is trained, ideally in just a couple minutes,  and then is available+valid for use until the geometry changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training data should come directly from the ray tracer (either in advance or streamed real-time).  Imagine shooting a million rays at an object from it's bounding sphere, some hit, some miss.  Each hit is not just the first hit but all the possible hits along the path.  That's the training corpus.  Rays input, hit list output.  We can probably shoot rays faster than the net can train an epoch, so you'd probably want to just stream rays as fast as it can train.  Alternatively, shoot a million, train, shoot another million, train, etc.<br>

<li>
<p>there's no threads on the topic.  general idea though would be to propose something CAD-related involving slam like making a portable 3D CAD scanner app. e.g., try to output CAD instead of just point clouds or meshes.  maybe hook into iphone lidar sensor.   could also be slam and point cloud based, but then imports into BRL-CAD on the fly for processing.  lots of possibilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You'd have to really make a strong case for your project regardless.  Needs to have a compelling benefit that ties into CAD specifically, not just 3D or vision or graphics-related.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. I went back and spent more time. I think I am getting closer to the true understanding. Its funny my understanding about the work keeps getting refined and is probably starting to converge. So it seems like the grid encoding is done on a per object basis - the inputs for both for the outer and inner network, while the networks itself are object agnostic occupancy predictors. So we would end up having two encoded grids (one for outer and one for innter) for each unique object and two network that are sort of object agnostic, but acts on any given object to predict occupancy. </p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, I would need to modify the ray tracing pipeline on our system - record input data - for both outer and inner network and then attempt to train those networks</p>
<p>So my two action items are</p>
<ol>
<li>Modify the existing pipeline to record data</li>
<li>Work on the network that can train on this</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I can do action 2 pretty independently (the networks are simple) but to do 1, I would need some directions on how I can do this. What's the fastest way to get there? Are there any documents /sections of code in our repository that I can go through to better understand how to do this? Also, I will try to setup BRL CAD (<a href="https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a>) in the first place, which I will get started with</p>
<p>I know we are interested in the core hypothesis of - is this fast enough? If there is a way to get this data, without having to collect it ourselves (may be any opensource datasets that can be directly plugged in), if any such options exist, the core hypothesis on speed can be validated quicker? Any thoughts on this</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="702819">@Matteo Balice</span> I looked over your proposal update and it looks really pretty good.  I like that you identified some potential errors in the tamu team's approach.   I think overall you have a good plan. </p>
<p>That said, I think you could make your proposal even better by more clearly identifying what the results of your project will be exactly.  I love that you dedicated time to writing up results -- it's reasonable to spend time getting a paper out of this work given the nature of the work.

<p>Is the goal to implement a non-grid sampling method, train on that, and demonstrate the efficacy of using that method with "rt" or something similar?  The tamu team resorted to a fixed view silhouette rendering via "rt" as their output target given they couldn't fully achieve generalization to 3D.</p>

<p>You mention nerf and potentially using different networks -- could definitely write more on what you mean there.  I do suspect that the simple 2-layer FCN is inadequate for full generalization, but AMD's results certainly suggest otherwise may be possible.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> Thank you for reading. Essentially, the goal is to achieve generalization, so we will try an approach aimed at improving the bounding box approach. However, even by adding this, I suspect that the neural network implemented by the students may not be sufficient to ensure good generalization for any view and thus for any arbitrary ray. For this reason, I believe (but it needs to be verified after obtaining the results of the first part) that it is reasonable to consider modifying the neural network with others more powerful to encode more information about the geometry of the 3D object. In any case, I will provide a better explanation in the proposal. Thank you.</p>

<p>An approach I think would be considerably more effective is generating training data based on spherical sampling.  That in practice does a very good job to sample the volume unbiased and converges through potential shotlines.  It's pretty simple to generate -- I just did that in our new "rtsurf" application.</p>

<p>So it seems that Tamu students have previously employed this method to generate training data, but encountered issues with its generalization. I believe that the neural network might be lacking in its ability to extract all pertinent information from the geometry.</p>

<p>I have not looked into their code to see whether they're actually evaluating the bounding box or bounding sphere, but I do recall them saying all rays sample through the origin so it's not an unbiased sampling regardless.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> you were right. I studied better what they did as sampling methods and it seems they used these two approaches: one is a grid approach (and ok we all agree it can't be used for generalization), the second is a mixed bounding box exactly like you said (ray origins were selected from a bounding sphere around the geometry, as well as from within the bounding sphere itself). <br>
But there was another approach they never tested, the "pure" bounding sphere approach: this<br>
method find a random point at radius distance away from the center of the geometry. This would serve as the ray origin. Then, it would find a different, random point at radius distance away from the origin. It would then determine the direction between the two points to determine the direction vector of the ray. It's pretty clear that this is the approach you suggested.<br>
This morning I had understood that they had used this latest approach (so I assumed that neither with this sampling they could generalize), but I was wrong. So, this changes everything because there might not be a need to implement any more sophisticated neural network (but it all depends on the results we will have on thanks to this different spherical sampling).</p>

<p>Yes, and I mentioned something to that effect -- it was absolutely made that simple in order to achieve their realtime performance goal.  What's still particularly amazing though is that it achieved such precise matching output on such a complex scene with so few parameters.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It will call rt_shootray one for each primary ray -- which typically results in secondary rays as well for reflection, specular, light/shadow samples, etc.  Rt is not a montecarlo renderer, but there are options like -H for hypersampling where there will be multiple samples per pixel.  There are also different lighting modes and different renderers that employ different methods.  For example -l7 uses photon mapping and the 'art' ray tracer is a PBR renderer based on appleseed.</p>

the center of the bounding sphere is the same as the bounding box, um, I think the AABB is used more than the sphere. iirc, when I did the metaball primitive, I did a bounding box, then just said the bounding sphere was the same center and had  a radius equal to the distance from  a corner of the bounding box to the center?</p>

<p>With n=100'000 rays I got 0.94% of accuracy which is not bad but the major problem is that with bounding sphere approach we need to sample a lot of rays in order to achieve a good accuracy for every angle of the camera.</p>

<p>The problem isn't with the Neural Network because I have a 0.99 accuracy with Training Set, but since we have an infinite number of rays that goes in all the directions in the bounding sphere, I think it is not possible to achieve the same results with the rendering without changing something because otherwise we need to sample an infinite number of rays to give to the NN (and of course it is not possible).</p>

<p>I don't know if it can improve the results, but have you tried giving to the network only the rays that hit the  object and not all the rays?<br>
This can be done because first we predict with "my" network if it has hitted or not, so "your" network should predict only the ones that hit the object</p>

<p>I think that grid encoding is appropriate only when the direction of the rays is fixed, because if you divide your sphere in 256*256 = 65536 cells, then each cell will have an average number of 15 rays to be trained (if your training set has 1 million rays). The problem is that if your direction is fixed, then 15 rays for each cell can be acceptable but if the direction isn't fixed, then 15 is a very small number of rays to train.<br>
I tried also with a different size of grid (20x20, 50x50, 100x100) and the NN performs like before more or less (98% accuracy with 20x20).<br>
I also implemented different grid versions  in the same NN (20x20, 50x50, 100x100, 256x256) and combined them together with some weights, but I got the same results...<br>
So this makes me think that grid encoding isn't appropriate when rays are not fixed.</p>

<p>There are two different kinds of cameras -- perspective and orthogonal.  Orthogonal is default for most engineering purposes and perspective is what you want for visualizations approximating human vision.  Perspective rays (typically) diverge.  Ortho are parallel grids. </p>

<p>That's clearly "seeing" the model in some sense, even getting some of the surfacing right but in a dream state.  How many training epochs is that?</p>
<p>One thing you could try is to reduce the input dimensionality to just azimuth and elevation (2 floats).  That's a much smaller space to optimize across and will result in the same centered visual for our current purposes.</p>

<p>Well fundamentally, nerfs are based on trying to obtain output visualizations of a 3D object based on just having some 2D view points (pictures).  They only use the 3D in the test and evaluation phase, but the model is generally unknown or non-existent.</p>

<p>We have the 3D models.  They aren't the unknown in our case.  Our situation is really needing to know precisely where the 3D object is for given (unknown) view points.  That's where the optimization and needs are a bit different.  It's more about encoding and/or estimating a given model from the known model, but sufficiently abstracted that we can get accurate queries really fast.</p>

<p>We could certainly build up and train a NeRF by feeding it a set of renderings for the 3D model, to see if it can generalize it well enough, but every approach I've seen thus far is about achieving optically adequate results, not necessarily something that would pass any fidelity comparison with the ground truth 3D model.</p>

<p>Ok, understood. However, I believe that AMD research still lacks comprehensive volumetric information about 3D models, preventing the NN from predicting rays hit/miss with 100% precision if we wanna achieve full generalization. Perhaps we can draw inspiration from NeRF and its related works. I plan to update my work on GitHub tomorrow so that you can review and test what I have done so far.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> Here there is the repo <a href="https://github.com/bralani/rt_volume/tree/neural_rendering">https://github.com/bralani/rt_volume/tree/neural_rendering</a>. Please be sure you follow in order these steps:</p>
<p>Installation:</p>
<p>1) Download libtorch from here <a href="https://pytorch.org/">https://pytorch.org/</a> paying attention to build "preview nightly" and remember the version you have installed (debug or release):<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/1549/cs8UI0afE68eGit_YprQNA4b/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/1549/cs8UI0afE68eGit_YprQNA4b/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/1549/cs8UI0afE68eGit_YprQNA4b/image.png"></a></div><p>2) Unzip the folder and put the libtorch folder wherever you want and then go to src\rt\CMakeLists.txt, line 56 and change these three paths with your libtorch path:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/1549/lSIfYYz08dyAGMJJlHun7s5K/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/1549/lSIfYYz08dyAGMJJlHun7s5K/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/1549/lSIfYYz08dyAGMJJlHun7s5K/image.png"></a></div><p>3) Now be sure to build "rt_trainneural" with "Debug" version if you have installed libtorch "Debug" or with "Release" if you have installed "Release" libtorch.</p>
<p>4) This step is not always required but in my case it was essential otherwise there were some issues in the execution: go to path_libtorch\lib, copy all the files inside this folder and paste these files in the build/bin (where there is the .exe) of brl-cad.</p>
<p>Ok now we can finally run the code with two steps:</p>
<p>Go to rt/train_neural.cpp and see these options:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/1549/Q5q8p-QQUbsZbaIqgTFJUmO_/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/1549/Q5q8p-QQUbsZbaIqgTFJUmO_/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/1549/Q5q8p-QQUbsZbaIqgTFJUmO_/image.png"></a></div><p>TRAINING:<br>
1)  In the first step we generate the dataset with bounding sphere sampling (so make sure that opts.generate_dataset is true), set your db and obj as you want and set also the num of rays you want to generate (I suggest 1 million). Run the code.<br>
2) You should see a file "train_neural.json" and "test_neural.txt" inside the path you have run the file (build/bin). <br>
3) Go to rt/train.py and set on top your variables:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/1549/CIY8U07xrP71pBjgOZJvlry5/image.png">image.png</a><br>
4) Run the script, the NN will stop on epoch 200 but on each epoch it validate on test set and if the accuracy of current epoch is higher than all the previous, it overwrites the model "<a href="http://model_sph.pt">model_sph.pt</a>".</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/1549/CIY8U07xrP71pBjgOZJvlry5/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/1549/CIY8U07xrP71pBjgOZJvlry5/image.png"></a></div><p>RENDERING:<br>
1) Go back to rt/train_neural.cpp, set opts.generate_dataset = false, set properly opts.model_path with the path of the model trained, adjust the azimuth and elevation as you wish (to perform render) and then set opts.neural_render=0 if you want the ground truth rendering, otherwise set to 1 if you want to perform your neural rendering. :)</p>

<p>Ok, understood. However, I believe that AMD research still lacks comprehensive volumetric information about 3D models, preventing the NN from predicting rays hit/miss with 100% precision if we wanna achieve full generalization. Perhaps we can draw inspiration from NeRF and its related works. I plan to update my work on GitHub tomorrow so that you can review and test what I have done so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to hear more what you meant by this -- encoding comprehensive volumetric information isn't the goal, but some faithful encoding.  A prediction with some general precision assertion (hopefully).  Similar in the text space, we want a reasonably accurate response to an input prompt that is more than vague (blurry) writing. </p>
<p>Issue I have with radiance fields is the method isn't exactly aligned well with our available training data.  We'd literally throw away information to then try to reconstitute it.  The method is really a whole field that's trying to construct 3D where it did not exist previously (i.e., from photos or scans).</p>

<p>From my reading, the AMD research is compelling because it is just a bifurcated training of two networks, one for outside, one for inside/near, and lots of reductions made for the sake of adequate performance.  My thinking is lets increase the network a bit, and see how well it can generalize.</p>

<p>I know that encoding volumetric informations are not the final goal, but I believe that the NN is not able to capture very well this details due to the lack of volumetric informations of the model itself. We could use for example an encoding like "voxels" because they are invariant to directions. This is just an idea for the moment, I don't know if it can work.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="702819">@Matteo Balice</span>  That is sort of incorporating some of the concepts of a radiance field (what you're calling a grid encoding), also known as a volumetric encoding.  Your intuition about the direction vectors being fixed does certainly sound plausible.  While the image space was fixed, the rays themselves were scattering in nearly all directions due to the physically based lighting model they were using (lots of reflection rays, refraction rays, light sampling rays, diffuse surface rays, and more).  Still, that is certainly a vast subset for the net to train on, and like I said, you have a reasoned impetus for trying to encode it volumetrically.</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of experimenting with grid net lately, and it's hard for him to predict rays in all directions, which may require a lot of parameters. One of the big problems is that the objective function is non-differentiable</p>

<p>Instead of using nif directly for rendering, AMD just uses NIF to intersect to speed up the rendering process. The focus is really on intersection, which is effective for rendering complex geometry.</p>

<p>Before implementing a more complex encoding (like sdf), today I tried first with positional encoding of Nerf's work. The idea is that MPL neural networks perform poorly at representing high-frequency variation in geometry. Mapping the inputs to a higher dimensional space using high frequency functions before passing them to the network enables better fitting of data that contains high frequency variation.</p>
<p>I got an improvement of 0.02% of accuracy, from 99.1% to 99.3%. These are two renders of the same objects but with different angles (and of course it's the same model without retraining):</p>

<p>Another idea I was thinking to help the NN is to modify a bit the sampling method. Now I use a totally randomic sampling around the bounding sphere but we can use a smarter approach using an importance sampling to sample more the regions where we are more uncertain.<br>
There are 4 steps: <br>
-first we sample randomly using the same approach as now.<br>
-Second, we can divide in N cells (like a grid) the rays basing on their origin and directions so that very similar rays will be found in the same cell.<br>
-Third, we calculate for each cell the uncertainty (very easy to calculate).<br>
-Lastly, We resemple but this time using the uncertainty in order to gather more samples in regions where we are more uncertain.</p>
<p>Do you think it could work?</p>

<p>Importance sampling would be good, but that's typically done as an optimization -- Would need to see a graph over epochs to see if this actually could converge onto the solution (even if over-trained).  Can you make a graph?</p>
<p>That said, I think it might help with some of the perimeter and higher frequency detail, but it's really easy to get the sampling ever so subtle wrong and introduce bias or error.  Kind of what to see proven that we can get a robust fit, that a given network topology is capable of precise match before going down that route.</p>

<p>Yes you are right. The dataset is unbalanced (more black than white) and this is the reason why accuracy is not the best in this case (I print also precision recall and better F1). But I remember that previous students used accuracy as the main metric and I wouldn’t change it. If you are interested in F1, it is 0.988 (a bit lower)</p>

<p>Just to remember (I know you are familiar with all of these):</p>
<ul>
<li>precision is the percentage of true and predicted hitted rays among those predicted and hitted.</li>
<li>recall is the pecentage of true predicted hitted rays among all true hitted rays.</li>
<li>F1 is an armonic mean between precision and recall.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think both precision and recall are important in our case, so I believe that F1 is the most significant one.</p>

<p>So it means that we need a more complex encoding or a more complex NN. For the moment I will focus on exploring encoding based on sdf.</p>

<p>To what end, what exactly do you mean?  If the end result is pixel approximation, then it will be potentially useful for visualization purposes (only).  That has use, but it's definitely a different target.  The distinguishing feature that makes this challenge is replacing rt_shootray() with a neural net or the slightly higher level do_pixel().  Going full image robustly might allow for a (real-time) preview.</p>

<p>Ok after studying some papers about sdf/nerf/gaussian splatting I have understood that one key information I do not actually use in the NN is the direction itself of the ray. Currently as input of the NN I use the spherical coordinates of the first and second intersection but not the direction vector.<br>
Before introducing any further and more complex encoding I need to add this new information as input of the NN because all these methods rely on the direction.<br>
I was thinking that we can use a smart idea to help the NN: we are not interested in the orientation of the vector direction but only on its direction. <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/1549/6TleqJhFROZ4p1NxNmqNi1yE/Direction-bounding-sphere.jpeg.png">Direction-bounding-sphere.jpeg.png</a><br>
Imagine a vector in 2D, the maximum range we can have is from 0 to 180 (red region) since we are interested only on its direction. So, if the vector is in the green area, all we need to do is reflecting its angle to the positive half space. <br>
The same idea can be applied to 3D vectors in spherical coordinates (with a fixed radius).<br>
I think that using these new input features will be beneficial for two reasons:<br>
1) we could use some more complex encoding based on sdf/gaussian that they all rely on the concept of direction.<br>
2) using these input features, we will have as the new input of our NN the first intersection on the bounding sphere and this new vector direction. The advantage is that the range of theta and phi (of the new vector direction) is smaller than the previous input features that used the full ranges in spherical coordinates of the second intersection on the bounding sphere. This should help the NN because it will have less input space to analyse but without loss of informations.</p>

<p>Ok I have added also the direction of the ray in the input features. As I was expecting, the NN does not improve adding the direction itself because we are not adding more informations but we are only using different features (I have also tried grid encoding).<br>
But the advantage is that now we can implement a more complex encoding that rely on the concept of direction.</p>

<p>I have 2 ideas about encodings to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>first idea (and the best one in my opinion) is similar to the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13495">DeepSDF</a>. The idea is to train latent vectors to predict the sdf for each ray.  Then this latent vectors will be the input of our NIF architecture. The problem is that we need to compute the sdf for each ray in the sampling approach.

Note that the sdf will be used only to train the latent vectors, so the NIF architecture won't use the sdf but only the latent vectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second one (more difficult than the first) is a similar work of  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13495">Neural pull</a>. In this case we do not have ground truth sdf, so the idea is to train latent vectors to "pull" rays towards the nearest surface by using the predicted signed distance values and their gradients, which the network computes. The movement of each rays is determined by the predicted distance and can be either towards or away from the surface, depending on the sign of the distance. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both the cases,  we need to choose an arbitrary number of latent vectors that will be associated to each direction (and this is the reason why I have added the direction to the input features).</p>
<p>I believe that if we can calculate the sdf for each ray the first encoding will be more efficient. I wait for your opinion. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="103542">@Erik</span></p>

<p>Today I made another improvement with gaussian splatting. I decided to associate a single gaussian to each positive hit of ray in the training set with a large variance.  Each gaussian has a mean (origin_theta, origin_phi, dir_phi, dir_theta) and a variance (variance_theta, variance_phi, dir_phi, dir_theta). Dir_phi and dir_theta are set to a fixed number of 0.05 because in my opinion we can save some memory in this way and the training process will be faster. The only thing the neural network is supposed to do is to find the maximum variance of each gaussian so that also the negative hits are correctly classified. <br>
The reason why we want to find the largest variance of gaussians is because of overfitting issues.</p>

<p>This works pretty good with 10000 rays but the problem is that if we increase just a bit the number of examples in the training set, the NN will become very complex in the number of parameters</p>

Ok I got it. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> You were right on all the estimations of the memory. The problem is in the decoder which you hadn't seen, when I calculate the probability of the examples that belongs to each gaussian.<br>
I had implemented broadcasting (to speed up calculations) so I clone the embeddings (gaussian) n times where n is the batch size (number of examples).<br>
In this image the batch size was of 256 examples.</p>

<p>Broadcasting in this case isn't probably a smart way to speed up calculations since a lot of gaussians are totally useless for the calculations of the probability for the current examples, but only the closest one to the current example are relevant.</p>

<p>I have solved the broadcasting issue that run out memory and I have first results. For the moment I am trying with only 10k rays because the calculation of probability is pretty slow.</p>
<p>Here the best epoch of the previous NIF network with only 10k rays:</p>
<p>F1: 0.880218316493941 <br>
Accuracy: 0.9283117186132877 <br>
Precision: 0.9087676930301201 <br>
Recall: 0.8534080886985007</p>
<p>Here, instead the best epoch with this new gaussian splatting network with 10K rays and only 1k gaussians embeddings (I decided to lower the number of gaussians to better explain the power of this model):</p>
<p>F1 Score: 0.9155<br>
Accuracy: 0.9261<br>
Precision: 0.9316<br>
Recall: 0.9000</p>
<p>As you can notice, the gaussian splatting architecture has more power than the NIF architecture BUT it is way slower. <br>
The interesting part is that I achieved this result in only 11 epochs, so the training is not slow but the inference is slow (the action from the start of the neural network to giving back the prediction).</p>
<p>For this reason, I will now focus on speeding up the gaussian splatting architecture. I believe I should read some papers about real-time renderings with gaussian splatting so as to achieve this speed up.</p>
<p>One idea I have is cutting some gaussians basing on the input I want to predict. (ie the furthest ones from the ray I want to predict).</p>
<p>P.S: the results I have showed here are not close to the ones of the previous week (accuracy: 0.994 and F1: 0.991) just because they were achieved with 1 Million examples. Here I use only 10k rays just to compare NIF architecture with Gaussian Splatting.</p>

<p>Today I had implemented parallelization of inference process and the training process is much faster. <br>
However, I had another problem with the covariance matrix. To calculate the pdf of a gaussian we need to invert the covariance matrix but when it is close to singularity, it is not possible to invert it. The problem is that the covariance matrix for all the gaussians has small values due to the nature of the problem (if you imagine each gaussian as an ellipsoid in 3D, it will have very small magnitude). <br>
To mitigate this problem I decided to use double precision (float64) and for the moment it seems to perform better.</p>

<p>Today I had further speed up the inference process by taking only the closest gaussians to the example to predict. I had also tried with more examples (100k) and the metric F1 improves even to 94-95%. However, it seems more difficult to improve this result with the current architecture. My opinion is due to the number of gaussians that now are fixed for all the training. The original paper (3DGS) uses instead a variable number of gaussians that can be lowered during the training process (if some gaussians have a very small variance) or it can be increased if the accuracy is low.</p>

<p>This could work but it means that  we have to change the sampling to fixed view sampling. I have some doubts about the number of views we should sample because:<br>
If we choose for example 1 million rays in the training set and we choose  a reasonable number of 1000 rays for each view this means that we have a total of 1000 views.<br>
If we distribute uniformly these views around the bounding sphere it means that, remember that theta goes from 0 to pi and phi goes from 0 to 2pi:<br>
In my case I can use half of phi because in my case the problem is simpler and the direction is invariant to orientation (so I have theta that goes from 0 to pi and phi that goes from 0 to pi):<br>
Theta x phi = 3,14 x 3,14 = 9,8596 -&gt; total space<br>
Uniform distribution of views:<br>
9,8596/1000 views = 0,009859 rad = 0,56° between two views. <br>
I think it is a reasonable error and it can be easily interpolated.<br>
In your case, however, you can't reduce the range of phi (because rgb is not invariant to orientations), so you will have:<br>
Theta x phi = 3,14 x 6,28 = 19,719 -&gt; total space<br>
19,719/1000 views = 0,0197 rad = 1,128° between two views. <br>
An error of 1° is reasonable also in your case and if my calculations are exact, it could work even in your case but the error is the double of mine.</p>

<p>That is absolutely not best practice and not recommended to ignore the predicted images solely based on having low percentages.  Not looking gives you no information.  Looking may give no information, or may provide helpful clues as to what isn't encoding well.  </p>
<p>It can be high frequency detail, it can be a straight up bug where values are simply shifted, it can be low frequency undulations, and more.  It's not in your interest to ignore them even if 19 times out of 20 it's just a "drunk wet mess".</p>

<p>I will just reiterate what we'd discussed earlier, that there should be two different approaches being taken (in general), or even better two different goals (e.g., 3d shape vs 2d image).  There is value in exploring the same method with different implementation detail (on the off chance there is some detail that matters more than anticipated).</p>

<p>It's not far off, but the separate networks is the key.  AMD really proved that surface illumination can be almost perfectly encoded for a given view.  Maybe if we were to first reproduce their research, that would give more confidence, but lacking that it's not terribly unexpected.</p>
<p>Now that said, I don't think there's a whole lot of difference with random rays in random dirs -- naively I think that can work with the right network and right amount of training.  Remains to be proven though.  The idea with the 32+ grid views, however, is a compromise, banking on the notion that a single view should converge that view.  In other analysis work we're involved with, there's mathematical proofs that lend evidence towards 32 views being a sweet spot approximation for complete random, converging much faster than pure random.</p>

<p>Again, I would just caution whether we're following research that is attempting to capture shape in the embedding or whether the goal is capturing the shape just barely enough that color, i.e., a visual image can be constructed that "looks good enough".  On quick read, that VINTER paper appears to be the latter, but I'd have to read it in more detail.</p>

<p>As for total number of views, I think you could try as coarse as 45-degree increments.  Resolution will need to be as fine as the smallest detail, which depends on the model size and detail complexity.  I'd personally start at 1024x1024, about 1M per view.</p>

<p>I have not rendered any frame for gaussian splatting network yet because if the percentage are under 0.97 - 0.98, the predicted image is very far from the true one. I prefer first to achieve better results and then plotting it.</p>

<p>That is absolutely not best practice and not recommended to ignore the predicted images solely based on having low percentages.  Not looking gives you no information.  Looking may give no information, or may provide helpful clues as to what isn't encoding well.  </p>
<p>It can be high frequency detail, it can be a straight up bug where values are simply shifted, it can be low frequency undulations, and more.  It's not in your interest to ignore them even if 19 times out of 20 it's just a "drunk wet mess".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you are totally right. I did not considered to render it because I got that result with only 100K rays and I wanted first to train the NN with at least 1 million rays. Thanks for the advise.</p>

<p>This idea is not far from the idea of grid encoding of direction which I have already tried without any improvement. In that case I used embeddings for each direction, you suggest using a network for each direction. I can try it. <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not far off, but the separate networks is the key.  AMD really proved that surface illumination can be almost perfectly encoded for a given view.  Maybe if we were to first reproduce their research, that would give more confidence, but lacking that it's not terribly unexpected.</p>
<p>Now that said, I don't think there's a whole lot of difference with random rays in random dirs -- naively I think that can work with the right network and right amount of training.  Remains to be proven though.  The idea with the 32+ grid views, however, is a compromise, banking on the notion that a single view should converge that view.  In other analysis work we're involved with, there's mathematical proofs that lend evidence towards 32 views being a sweet spot approximation for complete random, converging much faster than pure random.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was wondering... Isn't the limit of the previous NN (NIF network which I got 0.994 for accuracy) was simply that the number of examples in the training set was too low? Maybe we should try with even more samples (more than 1 million) to see how it works.</p>

<p>Yeah, the implementation seems pretty straightforward.  The main limitation is they didn't get a performance gain.  They train for a few minutes, then ray query performance is on par with the ray tracing time.  The one big gain they saw was getting that on-par ray tracing time with an order of magnitude less memory use.  So exceptional compression in the latent space.</p>

first,I give up bilinear interpolation and try to learn a matrix to express the relationship between neighboring vectors<br>
second, I consider neighboring vectors in the range 7&times;7 instead of 2&times;2<br>
third, I use a threshold to reduce noise.<br>

<p>The N-BVH paper was an outstanding talk -- will see if I can get a copy, but it's a direct response to AMD's NIF paper.   They key insight was to not use the ray+dir but to instead use 3 sample points along the ray on the interior of the bounding volume along with a BVH.<br>

<p>The key insight of using interior points was demonstrated with just 3-10 sample points which of course made training slower as points are added, but achieved essentially perfect occupancy recall even with high frequency detail.  Adding in a BVH was a training optimization so they could reduce it back down to just 3 points per BVH node.</p>

<p>I was studying that paper and had a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They mention using a batch size of 2^18 rays, which is 262,144.</li>
<li>They use a total of 100 batches.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means their training set consists of 2^18×100, equating to approximately 26 million rays. Moreover, they state that the training time is at most 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>I just discovered that it is indeed possible to use such a large batch size (I had been training NIF with a batch size of just 512 rays until now...). However, theory suggests that using a large batch size can increase variance error. Likely, with such a large training set, they do not encounter this issue.</p>
<p>What puzzles me most is how they can achieve convergence in just about 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>To investigate, I increased the batch size for the NIF model (with which I previously achieved an accuracy of 0.994). As expected, the model trains faster (20 minutes for 1 million rays), and the performance metrics remained roughly the same (just a little worse).</p>

<p>However, convergence for NIF is much slower than their approach, meaning that training a simple NIF requires more time and results in lower accuracy. Likely, the bounding volume hierarchies approach they use significantly helps the neural network.</p>

<p>I implemented the multi-resolution hash grid and I tested it on top of my previous NIF network. It's incredible how it converges in just few seconds even on my poor gpu.<br>
It achieves only 96% of F1 but it was expected since this encoding is not appropriated for rays+dir input (as we have in NIF) but they are appropriated for 3D points (like in NVBH).<br>

<p>Yes and no, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="700180">@fall Rainy</span> ...  BRL-CAD does have support for BREP models.  They import, display, and raytrace.  There's even some basic tessellation (conversion) and preliminary export support.  There's just not much support yet for editing and we want ray tracing performance to be better before we push it harder. </p>
<p>It's fundamentally no different than all the other primitives, can be used in boolean expressions (which raytrace just fine), can be volumetric/solid or plate-mode like meshes.  There's also some direct Boolean evaluation support which is converting BREP used in CSG expressions to BREP without CSG, but that work is incomplete. </p>
<p>What's really cool about that paper is the figured out how to encode solid geometry (in BREP form) into a NNet.  Not only is that a general concept that extends to other geometry forms, it's a way to actually encode <em>CAD</em> in the latent space, not just SDFs or volume grids or radiance fields.</p>

But how can we guarantee that they are sampled there if we do not know the intersection of the ray with the surface?</p>

<p>This is the reason why I uniformly sample along the ray (all the points have the same distance along the ray)... And this is the reason why increasing the number of points it converges with higher accuracy.</p>

Here there is the figure with only 10 points... As you can see it's pretty weird and the F1 metric is only about 0.97... Instead, with 70 points I got 0.998 of F1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's think for instance at the torus in the figure. Why is it so ugly? In my opinion, since we have rays that start and end in a bounding sphere, if we sample along these rays there is a medium/high probability that all the points sampled aren't close to the torus since this one is very thin. And this is the reason why the cube and the sphere are better represented (because their volume is larger and so it is easier that the points are closer to the cube/sphere).</p>

<p>In my opinion if we use BVHs that wrap the surface, not only we can use less sampling points but I think that also the accuracy must increase.</p>

<ol>
<li>most of the current hashencoder are for Cartesian coordinates, and I'd like to implement it with spherical coordinates(two version, both dir and pos imported as inputs, only pos imported as inputs)</li>

<p>Of course it's much slower BUT I have an idea. We can train the multi-resolution grid in this way (using a lot of points for each ray) but after the training we can take the grid already trained and build another model on top of this (without editing the grid) trying to predict the right "voxel" for each ray. We can leverage the fact that closest rays have closest "voxels" hit.</p>

<p>That's one of the optimizations mentioned in the paper -- the model is not only normalized in position, but also scaled/centered/normalized in size also.  So values are all 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 for XYZ.  That was pretty essential in limiting the training space.</p>

<p>In the end, for each ray I take the maximum for all the points sampled and this works well because:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the ray is a miss, all the points must have a probability less than 0.5 so taking the maximum it's ok.</li>
<li>if the ray is a hit, there should be at least one voxel in the ray that has a probability greater than 0.5 and using the maximum it's ok.</li>
</ul>

<p>This neural network works well in the training of the multi-resolution hash grid. My idea is to use the trained grid of this network as a base for another network much simpler and that uses less points. Do you have some ideas how to achieve this result (I proposed the idea of the hashmap; the paper used the BVH approach for instance)?</p>

<li>They used an MLP network with 4 hidden layers (each with relu) and a sigmoid as output but I simply use one single sigmoid layer as output without any hidden layer. (better in my network)</li>
<li>They used 8 levels for the grid, I use 4 levels. (better in my network)</li>
<li>They used a very high base resolution (8^3=512), I simply use 32 or 16 as a base resolution. (better in my network)</li>
<li>They used 4 features per level, I use 8 features. I have to try with 4 features. (better in their network)</li>

About rendering times, I think they are good because of course python is much slower than C++ (their code is in C++).<br>
Moreover, you have to take into consideration also a small overhead in my rendering time due to the conversion to spherical to cartesian coordinates (because my training set is in spherical coordinates as previous methods), but this can be easily avoided.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="700180">@fall Rainy</span> I have figured out why in my network using N = 200 has the same speed as N = 3. The difference with the NBVH network is that they encode N = 3 points and then they concatenate all of these 3 points in order so as to include also the direction of the vector. But the main difference is that the input of their network has 3 * number of features for each point.<br>
In my case it is different because I get 200 points BUT I compute in parallel all of these 200 points, so the input of my network is only 1 * number of features for each point because I do not need the direction of the ray (I just have to predict whether the voxel is hit/miss).</p>

<p>I had a talk on LinkedIn with Philippe Weier, the author of the nbvh paper and he said to me that the inference time of one ray depends on the time of computing the intersection of the ray with the first node + the time of getting the three points + the time of prediction. Then, if it is a miss, you should add the time of computing the intersection of the second node + etc...</p>
<p>I believe that their network can be improved using this approach:<br>
instead of using the bvh, we can simply get N = 201 points and merging them in order in triples of three points (67 triples). In this way we can parallelize all these computations in GPU and take only the informations on the first hit. I think it should be faster than the bvh approach.</p>

<p>I got another improvement in both rendering time and memory. Talking with the author of nbvh he suggested me to use only 1 number as the dimension of each level (and he was right because I only need to predict visibility ie the shape of the object).<br>
Here it is the grid:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/1549/wcgJrdT6FqnT1BYbTLnbJjlv/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/1549/wcgJrdT6FqnT1BYbTLnbJjlv/image.png" title="image.png"><img data-original-dimensions="1116x141" src="/user_uploads/thumbnail/1549/wcgJrdT6FqnT1BYbTLnbJjlv/image.png/840x560.webp"></a></div><p>Moreover, now the statistics are:</p>
<p>memory usage: 4,3mb<br>
max inference time: 5,2 ms in 1920x1080 (assuming all rays hit the bounding sphere, otherwise the time is lower)</p>
<p>These statistics are indipendent from the object encoded. I have tried with moss.g and statuette (one of their object) and the reason is very simple: I do not use any bvh, so every ray will have the same inference time IF the grid is the same between object. The only thing that can change between objects is the metric F1, because some objects can have small details that are more complex to encode but using this grid is ok both for moss.g and statuette.</p>

<p>I read these codes. It still looks like gridnet&amp;hashnet? not nbvh</p>

<p>Yes I call it nbvh but it is only hashnet and gridnet</p>

<p>These are the steps:<br>
1) I sample n_points on the segment between intersection1 and intersection2<br>
2) I calculate the probability of hit for each point<br>
3) I need to get the first hit point on these n_points but I need to get it in a differentiable way to calculate the loss function, so the function find_index_with_exponential_decay cover this issue</p>

<p>The L1 Loss says that there is an average error of 6 along each RGB channel. But I think that this value is not uniform for each pixel, because if you see on the shadows it is nearly perfect. So I believe that this error is an average between the bright areas (more than 6) and shadows one (almost perfect).</p>

<p>Well I don't think it will change the convergence because the encoders of loss2 and the others two losses are separate</p>

<p>No, a_dist isn't even set by librt -- that's an application-specific field so apps (e.g., rt) get to use it however they want.  So code you're using/calling has set or used a_dist and that's what you'll have to refer to in order to determine what is there.</p>

<p>One is the root solver saying it got 3 hits, which can happen on a couple primitives when rays just graze a surface.  We make it print to eventually see if we can special-case the condition but it doesn't affect ray tracing.</p>
<p>The other is a report of a geometry overlap which is a modeling error, which also doesn't affect the hit results you're using.</p>

<p>Today I did a big improvement in the number of sample points. Depending on the model, you need a fixed tolerance between each sampling point to ensure good accuracy: for example in moss a good tolerance is 0.01 (remember that we should sample in range 0-1 where 0 means that we are sampling on the origin and 1 means we are sampling on the destination on the bounding sphere).<br>
The trivial solution is using the uniform sampling for each ray (it was the solution I used before today). With uniform sampling you need a number of points that is equal to range/tolerance. This is the reason why in moss I need 1/0.01 = 100 points.</p>

<p>But we can do even better: we can divide our bounding sphere into cells (choosing an arbitrary resolution) and precompute the distribution for each pair of cell_origin and cell_destination. This way, the distribution no longer follows a Gaussian pattern but instead aligns with the local distribution in those areas. This represents a significant improvement because, not only do we capture the local distribution, but the range will also be reduced for almost all pairs. This is evident, as similar rays will have similar hit distances, as in this case:</p>

<p>Moreover not all the rays have the same length because in a bounding sphere (of ray 1) we have the maximum length for the rays that have exactly length equal to 2 * radius but all the other rays will have a smaller length so we can even sample less points</p>

This paper for example use a similar approach to my idea but they use an hashmap based on quantization of input (rays origin + rays destination) instead of cells</p>

<p>Either way, this is looking very much like you're approaching publication-worthy if you want to take this work to the next level... we could also probably turn it into a feature, depending on how long training takes, how long it takes to load the net, how long inference takes, etc.</p>

<p>They are real time lookups, you can see the code here <a href="https://github.com/bralani/rt_volume/blob/neural_rendering/src/rt/nvbh/camera.py">https://github.com/bralani/rt_volume/blob/neural_rendering/src/rt/nvbh/camera.py</a>. The inference time for each call of the forward method (ie this instruction output_label, _, _, output_rgb = model(input)) takes an average time of 1-2 ms for the havoc model (remember that in pygame the images are 256x256) but due to the limitations of python I have these metrics:<br>
Time to generate rays:  3.155 ms  -&gt; time to calculate the origin ray + direction ray for each pixel of the 256x256 camera<br>
Time to trace rays:  22 ms  -&gt; bottleneck due to the limitations of python (this includes the time to transfer data from cpu to gpu + the formula of intersection ray with sphere + the conversion to cartesian to spherical coordinates + the inference time + the time to transfer data from gpu to cpu. Since the inference time is only 1-2 ms, you can understand that all the time is taken by previous calculations + transfer time).<br>
Time to render image:  0.99 ms -&gt; time that pygame takes to show the input image<br>
So summing all together it takes something like 26 ms to render one frame (and it can be much better in C++) so I have an average of 36 FPS (in python).</p>

<p>Instead, with moss model I can use a simpler network (with less resolution) and less sampling points (I have not implemented the smart sampling yet, I am still using the uniform one at the moment) and the times are these ones:<br>
Time to generate rays:  3,15ms (the same as before)<br>
Time to trace rays:  15,6 ms (with an inference time that is still of 1-2 ms)<br>

<p>There was an error in the trace rays method, I did all the calculations on the cpu and I moved to the gpu just before the inference call. Now I move the rays after their generation and the times are these:</p>

Time to generate rays: 3,15ms (the same as before)<br>
Time to trace rays: 10,19 ms (with an inference time that is still of 1-2 ms)<br>

<p>The difference is evident: following the global distribution we are losing something on the boundaries (because there are less rays in those areas) but in all the other parts the resolution is way better.<br>
Following this sampling alone give us some advantages (but also drawbacks like you can see) but merging together with local distribution I expect to improve even more :)</p>

<p>A paper there will need to very clearly demonstrate what the significant contributions are of the work, distinct and compared with other recent papers.  Both efforts have demonstrated contributions, but will take some work to show how well or different they're performing on a test/benchmark common with some other paper (at least one).</p>
<p>The novel significant contribution will have to be identified first, which is going to be something like some % quality metric, or training convergence metric, or lookup performance metric, or some specific feature that hasn't been demonstrated (like sharp corners or some other measurable improvement).</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="702819">@Matteo Balice</span> this is outstanding performance that opens up a potential state-of-the-art contribution.  I'm not sure that's faster than the last paper that did 3 points -- you'd need to test the same models to really demonstrate that -- but it is a "new" capability if you can demonstrate something that ray traces slowly being looked up much faster.  That is, demonstrate this as a viable preprocess acceleration structure for models that are expensive to raytrace. </p>
<p>Towards exploring that, I'd suggest downloading a 3DM (NURBS) model, running 3dm-g and raytracing it.  It'll be slow as that's an unoptimized representation, but then you can show how long training takes, and how long inference/generation takes at the same resolution.  Suggest 1024x1024 since that's pretty standard and results in convenient 1M primary rays.</p>

Here here is the 256x256 frames resolution trained with 100 different 512x512 frames (in pygame I have implemented only 256x256 views with a small range of the camera).</p>
<div class="message_inline_image message_inline_video"><a href="/user_uploads/1549/rduCA2Y6x3cexL0-yVaBzuj8/pygame-window-2024-09-04-11-04-27.mp4" title="pygame-window-2024-09-04-11-04-27.mp4"><video preload="metadata" src="/user_uploads/1549/rduCA2Y6x3cexL0-yVaBzuj8/pygame-window-2024-09-04-11-04-27.mp4"></video></a></div><p>Regarding the 1024x1024, these are the times (in python without optimizations): <br>
Time to generate rays:  49,7 ms<br>
Time to trace rays:  12 ms<br>
Time to render image:  3,9 ms<br>
For a total time of 65,6 ms and an average 15,24 FPS. If you compare 65,6 ms (NN) with 66 seconds (true ray tracing on my mac M1), the NN is about 1006 times faster.</p>
<p>The true bottleneck is not the training time or the loading of the net but  the generation of the training set since generating 100 frames in 1024x1024 would require 100 x 66 seconds (on my pc) = almost 2 hours... For this reason I have trained only with 100 frames 512x512 (it has taken something like 30 minutes to generate the training set) and about 10 minutes to train it but I have not implemented the optimizations to reduce the number of sampling points yet (local sampling), so I expect that the training time (and inference) can be even smaller.</p>

<p>I was right, there was a bottleneck in the generation of rays, now it is less than 1ms to generate 1M rays so the bunny model is raytraced in about 16-17 ms.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if we could try for actual integration in the time remaining, or if the shift to writing up a paper is more in order.  For integration, it would entail modifying the 'rt' application to have a training mode where some command-line flag would tell it to train/use the neural net in place of the do_pixel() function (since you have color).  Something like rt -N bunny.weights bunny.g bunny</p>

<p>The training set consisted of 100 images with a resolution of 512x512 (approximately 26 million in total). The model was trained for approximately 5 minutes. The F1 loss for shape prediction was around 0.995. Additionally, the average error in predicting the hit position along the ray was about 0.006 -&gt; shape and hit position almost perfect.<br>
Regarding the RGB prediction, however, I have an average error of 24 (in "rgb" scale).</p>
<p>Each ray samples 200 points (each point has 3 float32 numbers: x y z) along its path, meaning each ray occupies 200 x (3 x 4 bytes (float32)) = 2,3 KB on the GPU. For training, I use a batch size of 2^13 rays per iteration, resulting in 2^13 x 2,3KB = 19.6 MB in memory.<br>
During the prediction process, the larger the batch size, the better the GPU parallelism can be utilized. Therefore, I load all 1024x1024 rays simultaneously, which requires 1024 x 1024 x 2,3 KB = 2,5 GB (my GPU allows it but it's ok to execute more iterations of the set of rays, it will be just a little bit slower).</p>
<p>I believe it is possible to reduce the number of sampling points but I am still working on it, I have not achieved good results for example sampling locally.</p>

<p>Regarding the integration there are some points to understand first in order to achieve good results in inference time like I had in python:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all we need batch processing of multiple rays in parallel (for examples 2^13 rays in parallel). Is there already implemented batch processing of rays in brl-cad?</li>

<ul>
<li>Second, I believe that it's better to write the NN in C++ and not binding with python to speed up even more, but this means that we need to write manually the code in CUDA for the GPU (for example I use the function torch.max in pytorch that are optimized for cuda GPUs).</li>

<p>I believe our approach is more suited to GPUs compared to NBVH, as it involves fewer conditional branches. This is because we completely avoid using BVHs; the only intersection we calculate is with the bounding sphere. After that, the inference process remains consistent for every ray, exploiting the true power of GPUs. This is the reason why even using more sampling point we have good results in inference time.</p>

<p>I discovered one drawback: when I render the scene in 1024x1024 in pygame it's good for the first seconds (16-17 ms for each frame) but after that the memory of GPU goes to 100% and the inference time slow down a lot. Probably this is because they do not use well the garbage collector of tensors accumulated for previous frames (I have a RTX 4070 with 13GB of VRAM).</p>

<p>I attempted also to integrate the PyTorch code into the rt module, but encountered an issue with the PyTorch library I used for multi-hash resolution. The problem is that the library includes CUDA-specific scripts, preventing me from exporting the neural network...</p>

<p>Regarding the 1024x1024, these are the times (in python without optimizations): <br>
Time to generate rays:  49,7 ms<br>
Time to trace rays:  12 ms<br>
Time to render image:  3,9 ms<br>
For a total time of 65,6 ms and an average 15,24 FPS. If you compare 65,6 ms (NN) with 66 seconds (true ray tracing on my mac M1), the NN is about 1006 times faster.</p>
<p>The true bottleneck is not the training time or the loading of the net but  the generation of the training set since generating 100 frames in 1024x1024 would require 100 x 66 seconds (on my pc) = almost 2 hours... For this reason I have trained only with 100 frames 512x512 (it has taken something like 30 minutes to generate the training set) and about 10 minutes to train it but I have not implemented the optimizations to reduce the number of sampling points yet (local sampling), so I expect that the training time (and inference) can be even smaller.</p>

<p>Wonder if we could show bunny spinning orbitally.  This video is really good results but the view stays focused on the bunny’s butt.. even a simple 360 orbital would probably do well.</p>
