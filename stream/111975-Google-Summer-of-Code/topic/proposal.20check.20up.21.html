<p>Hi everyone!  How are those proposals coming along?  Please pay attention to the submission deadline as there are ZERO exceptions made for people that don't submit a final before the deadline.  If you're working on patches or code and don't have a draft yet, you should stop and start writing.  You can write about any progress or research you have made in your proposal.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215774">@Louis Googl</span> you're welcome to upload and work on your proposal on the BRL-CAD wiki, but you don't have to.  I believe the summerofcode site allows you to upload a Google Docs link as well as a PDF for the Final.</p>

<p>Students, please do remember to submit your FINAL proposal before the deadline, regardless of whether you have received feedback or not.  There are ZERO exceptions for anyone that fails to do so, no matter the reason, even if the website goes down in the last 10 minutes.</p>
