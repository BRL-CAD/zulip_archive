<p>I have a small concern here, if I'll have to showcase what I proposed i need to only send pr with very minor and small changes. If I'll have to make bigger changes I'll need to do it in systematic way and update chunks of the code base at once so that the application doesn't break and it runs properly (which translates to the proposed project itself)</p>

<p>Start with something as small as you can find but that is some actual improvement, or fix, etc</p>

<p>If you really want to impress, make it directly related to your project in some manner, but it should be a complete and standalone change, not some work in progress.  But still, any change that is “complete” however small will be better than a bigger change than it not, or worse no change demonstrated</p>
