<p>Hey GSoC students, feel free to share a draft of your BRL-CAD proposals if you'd like feedback!  We've not heard from many of you so those that do communicate more will have our attention (in a good way).  We'll gladly help you figure out the best project scope and objectives.</p>

<p>and to anyone new or lurking, it's not too late to get started now!  we haven't yet seen a proposal for any of our priority topics, so odds are good if you propose something good!</p>

<p>with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="103555">@Shubham Rathore</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102902">@Sean</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="102939">@Daniel Rossberg</span>  's help I was able to get a small fix done</p>
<p>1. <a href="#narrow/stream/111975-Google-Summer.20of.20Code/topic/Annotations/near/161567985" title="#narrow/stream/111975-Google-Summer.20of.20Code/topic/Annotations/near/161567985">https://brlcad.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/111975-Google-Summer.20of.20Code/topic/Annotations/near/161567985</a> <br>
 and i am currently working on another bug. Should I mention all this work in the proposal along with other similar project related work.for example, i was able to get pull request accepted in openscad organization  as well which comes under brlcad umbrella organisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/2876" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/2876">https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/2876</a></p>
<p>2. As we are an opensource organisation and believe in sharing do we have to share the initial proposal draft on zulip chat platform or have to drop the community members a mail ?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="211316">@Chetan Shinde</span> 1. yes, definitely mention it.  2. you do not have to share your proposal draft publicly if you do not want to, but it is encouraged.  you should not be worried about others seeing your ideas.  it's VERY obvious when others plagiarize or copy-paste a similar idea.  plus, what matters just as much if not more is demonstrating productivity like you are doing by working on existing bugs or small features.</p>
