<p>I had also prepared tasks in advance, I stopped to do it one week ago but I still have Appleseed #4 almost done, just a little bug to find, the two annot bugs I tried to find for hours (which I finally didn't found but I think I'm close) and the BRL-CAD modeling task which I had done the half</p>
