I’m particularly interested in the Geometry Verification and Validation GUI in Qt (AI Project) and would love to help enhance the existing prototype by improving usability, adding new checks, refining Qt GUI integration, or incorporating AI for issue detection and repair.</p>\n<p>I’ve already looked at Geometry_V&amp;V.tar.gz to understand the existing work. I’d love to discuss possible improvements and define specific project objectives. Could you guide me on the best next steps?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nVaibhav Wadhwani</p>",
