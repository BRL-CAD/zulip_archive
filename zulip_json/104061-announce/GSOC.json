The key to do so is to learn as much as possible about the programs and how they are implemented. I.e.,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn about the different BRL-CAD programs. You can install the latest <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases/tag/rel-7-42-0\">release for Windows</a>. Start an archer or mged GUI. Do the <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">tutorial</a>.</li>\n<li>Compile the <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">main repository</a> by yourself.</li>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with the different possibilities to program BRL-CAD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, we expect a code contribution too, to show your skills, but this is usually a minor task.</p>\n<p>You can move the discussion of Python binding specific stuff to <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"111975\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/111975-Google-Summer-of-Code/topic/BRL-CAD.20Python.20Bindings/with/431505583\">#Google Summer of Code &gt; BRL-CAD Python Bindings</a>.</p>",
