        "content": "<p>Hi Everyone, <br>\nI am Tejas,<br>\nI want to work on the FreeCAD Robot workbench. The main problem that I see In the existing version of freeCAD, is that there are no constraints in the axis of the robot. that makes it follow trajectories in unrealistic ways. The robot arms overlap with each other. This can be solved by getting the values from .stl/STEP files or any other neutral 3D format. The data of the links’ surface can be used to put constrains to avoid overlap of the links. <br>\nAlso there are some other bugs. As shown in the figure, when a trajectory is selected, the user doesn’t have any control over the starting position and orientation of the robot. I would like to add a feature in which the user can add initial position-orientation matrix or position the bot partially at the starting point. <br>\nI want to do this as a project under GSoC and need a mentor for that. Please message me if any mentor is interested in this area. I have a decent amount of theoretical background in robotic kinematics and will be needing help just to clarify a few doubts related to coding and writing the proposal. <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/fX1EHLS4vBWJeHaKCfKN3OXD/2018-03-14-at-18-07-24.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2018-03-14-at-18-07-24.png\">2018-03-14-at-18-07-24.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/fX1EHLS4vBWJeHaKCfKN3OXD/2018-03-14-at-18-07-24.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2018-03-14-at-18-07-24.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/1549/fX1EHLS4vBWJeHaKCfKN3OXD/2018-03-14-at-18-07-24.png\"></a></div>",
