What's worthwhile?<br>\nSomething I really liked was the explanations of each command, such as the Clone command or the creation of shapes. It became very simple to understand what individual command did in the command window. <br>\nImprove<br>\nWhat should we CHANGE? What should we improve? What could be better?<br>\nSomething that should be changed is the ordering of the pieces. I feel as though the knight is one of the easier pieces to create and understand as opposed to the pawn where the torus is subtracted.<br>\nStop<br>\nWhat should we STOP doing? What's not working well? What's a waste of time?<br>\nI definitely think that the queen piece was a waste of time, as it was just a list of commands to be put into the command prompt. I feel as though it would have been better if the user made the queen themselves with a little bit of guidance.<br>\nStart<br>\nWhat should we START doing? What would add value? What new process might help?<br>\nA process that I personally think would be useful is adding together all of the different databases of pieces together on the board. It would help my understanding of creating different parts and then combing them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
