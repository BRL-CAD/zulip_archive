They are amazing and quite challenging, but I believe they can be completed before a given time interval. This will surely be accepted in GSoD,21. I found them via a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/season-of-docs/blob/main/2021-participants/interested-organizations.md\">season of doc repo</a>.</p>\n<p>I have gone through all the minimum scope mentioned for this project as on the <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Season_of_Docs/Proposal\">website</a>. With some conversions being automatic, while some required to be converted manually. I believe this can be completed before the end date. I have been passionately writing tutorials, blogs, reviews about open-source projects and am familiar with DocBook XML and AsciiDoc. Gone through different conversion ideas, I believe I have got some idea of how to proceed with the conversion.</p>\n<p>You can find my previous work at <a href=\"https://abhishek-iiit.medium.com/\">medium</a>, <a href=\"https://abhishek-iiit.hashnode.dev/\">hashnode</a> . I would give my best to achieve this goal.<br>\nCould you please provide my some more reference, so that I may get into depth in this project. Any feedback and suggestion are most welcome.</p>",
