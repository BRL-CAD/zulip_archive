Pretty sure that's why the flurry of reviews slowed...  Let me know if you want me to bump it back down.</p>",

I reduced it recently, because we don't really have follow up tasks for this one. The issue arose that many students used V2 to do the V3 GUI test tasks.<br>\nWhen they do the \"Build from source\" V2/V3 tasks instead,  they can continue with coding tasks.</p>",
