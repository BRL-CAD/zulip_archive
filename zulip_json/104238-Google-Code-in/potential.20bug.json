While all references to it seem to still be intact (i.e. it is selectable using <code>sed</code>,  shows up when <code>ls</code> is ran), the 3d cylinder itself seems to disappear. When it is the only object being drawn, running <code>rt</code> gives an error stating that there is no regions detected.</p>",
