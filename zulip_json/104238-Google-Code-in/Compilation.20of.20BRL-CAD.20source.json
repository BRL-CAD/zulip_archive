Then build the INSTALL target. The issue with the ALLBUILD target is that it doesn't copy the files in the order of a BRL-CAD installation. This is what INSTALL does. The reason for the errors you experienced could have been that you hadn't write access to the install directory which is something in C:/Program Files/ by default.</p>",
