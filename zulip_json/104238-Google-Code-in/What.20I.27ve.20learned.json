After-all, putting the contest prizes aside, I'm sure a lot of us are here to learn and grow as individuals. I'll start off with some things I've studied in the past few weeks because of BRLCAD: </p>\n<p>1) CMake build structures<br>\n2) Attribution (it's customary to attribute a creator even if they don't explicitly ask for it) <br>\n3) Basic 3D Modelling -- I had no prior experience so this was interesting <br>\n4) General understanding of computer graphic terms such as ray tracing/ ray casting, parallel projection, orthogonal projection, oblique projection, homogeneous coordinates, etc.... </p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to coming back in the next month or so and smiling at how silly I was for not understanding something incredibly simple :P</p>",
