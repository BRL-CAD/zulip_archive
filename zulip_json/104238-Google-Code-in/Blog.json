I've found approximately the same time for bn_randmt and SFMT (which is interesting because I used msse2 but it doesn't seem to be faster). On the other hand, for the STL rand I found a number totally different: 4114 instead of 11461 (even faster than SFMT)! That's because I didn't use the same implementation as you.</p>",
