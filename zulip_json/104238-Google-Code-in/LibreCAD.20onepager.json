You can set Stream and Topic above your text input box.<br>\nThis makes it easy to keep focus on a Stream or Topic by hiding others for a intense conversation.</p>\n<p>So now, get to your question. The intention behind this task is, that the current site is outdated. This is because there are only a few people having permission and they prefer other tasks in the community. So the goal for the new site is, to have as less as possible maintenance. That means no specific information that may become mature, e.g. install instructions or version numbers. These informations are kept at our other resources like github, sourceforge or wiki.<br>\nSo the main function for the new site is to give general info about LibreCAD community and link to more maintained resources.<br>\nYou may add a screen shot or two on the new site, but I don't see the place for an image gallery there. <br>\nI think the wiki would be the right place for an image collection if needed at all.</p>\n<p>What kind of images do you have in mind for an image gallery?</p>",
