At a glance, they are rather involved, complicated, and I'm not sure how much Windows 7 is having an influence.  We're no longer doing testing and development on 7, so hopefully only the datetime issue is limited to that version issue.</p>",

No worry about Windows 7.  I did replace GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime with GetSystemTimeAsFileTime to get my system to run on Windows 7.  If precise timing is required for the importers, indeed it would be my system.  I will upgrade to Windows 8 and give it run again.  By the way, the 3dm-g importer is quite impressive.  Some  none trivial models I converted to . g database are private so couldn't show publicly, but they look really amazing on archer.</p>",
