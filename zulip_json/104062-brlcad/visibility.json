It generates a top-down visualization of some geometry showing where there's visibility and where things are occluded.  It's kind of like a 2.5D rtarea.  The visuals are awesome and the scripting is exercising a dozen tools.  All I think is missing for this to be general is a way to specify eye points.</p>",
