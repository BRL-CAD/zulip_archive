        "content": "<p>Hello everyone,<br>\nI’m Rishith, a B.Tech CSE student from India. I recently built brl cad 7.42.0 from source on Ubuntu (WSL2). I’m currently running mged directly from the build tree without doing a \"make install\", since I understand installation is not required for development. So far, it is compiling and running without any errors, and I’ve been using mged to create some basic geometry. I also have strong foundations in C and I’m interested in contributing.</p>\n<p>I wanted to ask if brl cad is likely to participate in GSoC 2026. I know this may not be confirmed yet, but I wanted to check early so I can plan my learning and contributions properly. I also noticed that some docs pages on the website seem to be down, so I’m bit confused.</p>\n<p>Could someone please guide me on what the next step should be for a new contributor? Should I focus more on learning mged, or start exploring specific parts of the codebase? Also, is a gui setup required at any point for development? Any guidance would be really helpful.<br>\nThank you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/VAzYavNa4bKZ-6s64NS8UPog/Screenshot-2025-12-15-005950.png\">Screenshot 2025-12-15 005950.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/VAzYavNa4bKZ-6s64NS8UPog/Screenshot-2025-12-15-005950.png\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-12-15 005950.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"994x529\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/1549/VAzYavNa4bKZ-6s64NS8UPog/Screenshot-2025-12-15-005950.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",

It walks the rd_hit hitmiss list and writes a .plot3 file that visualizes the ray segments, color-coded by NMG ray state (INSIDE / ON / OUTSIDE), including state transitions and the ray continuation past the last hit.</p>\n<p>So it looks mainly intended for debugging or visually inspecting NMG ray classification behavior, not for production raytracing. That would also explain the direct file output, hardcoded naming, and lack of documentation or runtime control, which makes it feel like legacy/debug cruft today.</p>\n<p>A reasonable next step on my side would be to trace where pl_ray() is actually invoked (and under what conditions), and see whether it’s still exercised by any current debug paths, or whether it should be better documented, guarded, or potentially deprecated. Let me know if that aligns with what you had in mind, or if there’s historical context I should be aware of first.</p>",

One is inside nmg_ray_segs() under NMG_DEBUG_RT_SEGS, but the other is in unresolved(), where pl_ray(rd) is called unconditionally when a state transition cannot be fixed.</p>\n<p>That unconditional call in unresolved() seems to explain why plot3 files get written even without explicit debug intent, and why it can spam the working directory when NMG ray issues occur.</p>\n<p>As a first step, I think it would make sense to guard pl_ray() behind an appropriate librt debug flag (or possibly reuse an existing one) so that plot files are only generated when explicitly requested.
