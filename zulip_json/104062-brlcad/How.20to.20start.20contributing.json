I.e.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Install the main programs. You can find installation binaries for Windows among the releases <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases</a>. If you don't want to start with Windows, you have to compile the programs by yourself first. For doing this, see next section.<br>\nThe installation contains a huge amount of programs. Most of them are small command line tools. You should look at our old but still heavily used GUI <strong>mged</strong> and the more modern GUI <strong>archer</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With both, you can go through the tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next step would be compiling the programs from sources. This is, of course, necessary for contributing to the programs in our main repository. But, even if you are interested in web-programming, like our <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor\">Online Geometry Viewer</a> or writing a Python API (where you need an installed BRL-CAD only), without being able to compile it by yourself, you cannot benefit from latest improvements. Therefore</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a>.</li>\n<li>Compile, and install the programs (see <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Links with ideas for small contributions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/BUGS\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/BUGS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/TODO\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/TODO</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last, some remarks regarding GSoC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GSoC is not a simple paid programming. You won't get a list of functions you have to implement. Rather, you have to propose your own short (approx. 3 months) software development project. I.e., you are your own project manager. Of course, you get help making the plan and carrying it out.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/labels/Project%3A%20BRL-CAD\">This</a> are some ideas for GSoC projects. GSoC 2025 however hasn't started and we haven't decided about participation, priorities, etc. yet.</li>\n</ul>",
