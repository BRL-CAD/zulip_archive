That matters more than anything.</p>\n<p>BRL-CAD is by far the fastest solid geometry ray tracer.  There are faster non-solid (e.g., triangle) tracers and academic demos, but nothing in the class of solid geometry and nothing as verified for analytic use that I'm aware of.</p>\n<p>In all my comparisons against commercial CAD ray tracing (e.g., Creo, NX, CATIA, etc), BRL-CAD's ray tracer has been orders of magnitude faster.  Getting a truly apples-to-apples comparison is really hard, but it's usually not even in the ballpark.  Depending on the format and complexity of the geometry and hardware capabilities, LIBRT is typically 10k-100M rays per sec per CPU core.  The commercial options I've seen are usually in the 100-10k rays per sec per CPU core range.</p>",

I could not see any sample programs but I tried a couple of code to get deviceinfo, It was working.Do I need to run cpu only (without gpu)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If it froze, you should be able to attach to the process using gdb to see where/why it's frozen.  Get the PID of the rt process, then run gdb, and run the command \"attach [pid]\" where [pid] is the rt process ID (e.g., 12345).</p>\n<p>You shouldn't need to run cpu only.  It will try gpu and if that fails, it will fall back to cpu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"102902\">Sean</span>  I tried run rt with windbg .
