It looks as if the openbsd guys have cleaned up a small public domain emacs-alike editor which should handle most platforms other than Windows (<a href=\"https://github.com/troglobit/mg\">https://github.com/troglobit/mg</a>).  For Windows it looks like someone has recreated something similar to edit.exe under MIT license:  <a href=\"https://github.com/malxau/yori\">https://github.com/malxau/yori</a></p>",

Theory is that will be less clutter if we end up pulling them out again than adding bext dependency repos (which couldn't get pulled out without breaking history.)</p>\n<p>As a general note, shouldn't put things in misc/tools over bext without discussing first - particularly if the source code in question is large.  Also, on the bext side of things, it's good practice to experiment with dependencies in a fork or branch first before committing them to the main history.  Once they're in main we can't delete them without breaking history.</p>\n<p>We do have a lot of projects present in bext, but to date they are all either direct dependencies being staged for BRL-CAD features or dependencies of those dependencies (or build tools like astyle.)  Appearances aside, bext isn't actually intended to be a catch-all for anything that <em>might</em> be of interest.</p>",
