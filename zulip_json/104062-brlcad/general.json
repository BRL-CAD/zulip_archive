It's just checking them so you understand what their values are and aren't just relying on what you see in the graphics window.  For example, you might see a sphere, but how big is the sphere?  where is the sphere?  is it big because someone edited the sphere directly to be big or is it big because there's a matrix that scales it up bigger in some other combination.  things like that.  all about understanding the values of things.</p>",

What can be the problem? ```<br>\nThere's not enough information to say what went wrong, but the fact that the output file is zero bytes means it failed or stopped.  That can happen for any number of reasons, but one of the more common ones is not having proper region definitions and/or having objects that are near tangent.  There's no universal solution.  It's a really complex problem that has to be examined bit by bit.</p>\n<p>One thing you can try is to just output the tower one piece at a time, for example just the base, then just the needle without the petals, then just the petals, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There's the k-g.cpp that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112516\">@starseeker</span> started a few years ago, so you could start with that and pick his brain on what works and doesn't work -- that's probably the best place to start.

There are some non-geometric constructs that we support, but I don't think they are a priority.</p>\n<p>For example, a DISCRETE_ELEMENT describes some sort of connection between two objects.  That's a connection/association construct, but non-geometric.  So you have options.. you could put the two objects (N1 and N2) into a combination together (unioned), or you could create a 'joint' object to represent the connection, or you could  encode the parameters as an attribute, or you could ignore it for now since it's not geometric.</p>\n<p>For MASS_ELEMENT, that one is also non-geometric, but it is a property that we support in a super-simplified form.  So you could choose to ignore it or import it.  BRL-CAD has a materiaID number -- it's a number that represents some material type and has an associated density (which can be used to calculate mass).  So an object123 might have a materialID=3, which might be \"Iron\" with a density of \"3.81239 g/cm^3\".  A MASS_ELEMENT is the inverse of that concept, so I'd probably just encode the mass as an attribute (e.g., dyna::mass_element.mass=123.321)</p>\n<p>As for ELEMENT_BEAM ... I think that one may be geometric.  It appears to implicitly describe an arb8 ... <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Coordinate-system-of-2-node-beam-element_fig4_283381413\">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Coordinate-system-of-2-node-beam-element_fig4_283381413</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also could not find a good doc showing all elements_solid notation (eg, node number) for example 20-10 - 15 nodes brick or prism, if there are ?  4-6-8 nodes are already done.

It also lends itself fairly well to interactive, scripted interface creation (as opposed to needing the compile/run cycle of C++.)  That has resulted in a lot of its footprint in the development community being in those niches - it's not too unusual for the first hits on a Tk interface question search to be returned in something like the Python bindings for Tk, not Tcl or C.  </p>\n<p>When you move beyond \"scripted\" interactive GUI development, however, the Qt C++ toolkit is quite powerful, having a number of significant \"built-in\" features Tk does not.  There are also considerations not related directly to toolkit feature sets - my two main issues with trying to apply Tk for \"large scale\" desktop application development  are 1)  it doesn't keep up very well with \"modern\" user interface styling (the development community using  it doesn't have a strong need to do so, unlike Qt's community) and 2) any non-trivial graphical interfaces implemented in Tk are rather difficult to test and debug.  I've found GDB and/or LLDB to be invaluable in my own user interface work the last few years, and the Tcl/Tk environment doesn't really have an equivalent.  Nor is it possible to use all the Tk features from C without involving Tcl.</p>",

After considerable effort over many years we have now managed to decouple our core libraries up through the libged layer from Tcl/Tk.  That means any logic we migrate down to those lower levels is available to be reused by ANY interface communicating with our libraries - be it Tcl/Tk, Java, Qt, FLTK, etc.  That way, in another twenty years when we may very well have to migrate from Qt to some other solution, we minimize the amount of rewriting we will have to execute.  We cannot afford to remain completely aloof from the ebbs and flows of community focus when it comes to interface layers - we lack the resources to maintain our own solution to the general problem of cross-platform desktop GUI frameworks, nor is such development our purpose as a project.  However, the more we minimize our own logic's entanglement with any particular framework, the easier, faster, and cheaper those migrations become.</p>",

Data-oriented programming aims to specifically code for locality as a primary concern and structure your classes and data structures around that instead, which can lead to vastly different performance characteristics (2+ orders of magnitude faster when done well).  Of course devil is very much in the details and nothing really happens without profiling.</p>",

OS is an Ubuntu derivative.</p>\n<p>Some personal hints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <code>cmake-gui</code>. It makes it easier to set up everything right.</li>\n<li>Choose an install directory, where you have write rights, e.g. something like <code>/home/john/bin/brlcad</code>. Set the value of the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX accordingly and install BRL-CAD there (<code>make install</code>).</li>\n<li>You should not need to touch the other CMake variables.</li>\n</ul>",
