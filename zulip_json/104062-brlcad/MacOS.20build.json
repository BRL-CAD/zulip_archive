I think the GitHub runners bumped versions on something recently, and after working around a couple compile errors I'm getting some sort of weird \"process killed\" failure when trying to run things after the compile completes.  It feels a little like the early problems I had getting bext to work on OSX when I didn't know about the issues path updates cause with code signing, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening again.  If anybody can reproduce and debug (right now I can do so only on the CI runners, which isn't ideal for iterating, to say the very least) it would be helpful.</p>",
