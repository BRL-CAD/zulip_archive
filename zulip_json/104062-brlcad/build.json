You can run mged with options (e.g., mged -c) to run without a GUI or in command mode (e.g., mged file.g tops) where it's not quite so bad even to step through all of the Tcl processing, but setting a breakpoint on a function or file:line that you are interested in works really well for most debugging needs.</p>",

Well, the straight answer is: Because the code was taken from src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch.c. I.e., the sketch should have similar issues than the annotation.</p>\n<p>But then? <em>pt</em> is used in the <em>CURVE_NURB_MAGIC</em> section as well, and <em>nmg_nurb_c_eval()</em> seems to like an array of 4 doubles as third parameter. This is where the 4 came from. I.e., your solution is probable the best what one can do here. Another possibility, which means the same is <code>hpoint_t pt = HINIT_ZERO;</code>.</p>\n<p>However, you should submit a patch for this.</p>\n<p>BTW, not all calls of <em>nmg_nurb_c_eval()</em> are using hpoint_t.

You nailed the cause as an initialization issue: The z coordinate of the <em>pt</em> vector wasn't initialized explicitly, so the compiler decided about it. The GNU compiler seems to initialize the variables with 0 by default. Visual Studio uses a different bit-pattern which looks bad as double (but is in fact good because it makes such initialization issues obvious). Therefore, the solution is to explicitly initialize <em>pt</em> as you did.</p>\n<p>Then there is of cause the question why the <em>pt</em> vector looks so different than the other vectors there.  The answer is, because it is used with a function which expects a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates#Use_in_computer_graphics_and_computer_vision\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates#Use_in_computer_graphics_and_computer_vision\">homogeneous coordinate</a>.</p>",
