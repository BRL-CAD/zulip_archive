Guess we have wires crossed, maybe we should write it out more explicitly.  The gist I've always known is that RELEASE should be only what is strictly necessary to stabilize, finalize, and prepare a release.  For example, typically compilation/portability issues detected during testing and final adjustments to release notes/docs.  The branch should almost exclusively pull feature/logic changes from trunk.  Multiple reasons for the separation,  but IA would be a main concern for us so there's never really a need to review changes committed to RELEASE (or STABLE) as they should  just be necessary machinery.  The other intention is that trunk -&gt; RELEASE -&gt; STABLE -&gt; tag should be a gradient of increasing stability or at least decreasing risk.</p>",
