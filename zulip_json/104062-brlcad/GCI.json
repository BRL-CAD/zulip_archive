Basically, the only thing different in rtuif apps is the set of callbacks, which are called during rt_shootray() automatically and provided by each application.  So literally the entire app-specific logic for rtedge for example lives in viewedge.c and for rtxray in viewxray.c etc.  An RTUIF function sets up the grid, sets up parallel ray tracing, sets up the scene and lighting, etc., and calls those callbacks as defined.</p>",

But for a sphere (and most models you'll encounter), it simply won't matter.  Most scenes render on the order of 100k to 10M rays per second in parallel, and a sphere is something like 100M rays/s, so even single threaded it's going to b millions per second.</p>",

One goal of GCI is to teach young people how open source communities work. We understand, that students are excited and eager, especially when it is there first year in GCI.<br>\nOpen source communities are spread all over the world, in differrent time zones, with different life styles and schedules. This is why you need patience in community chats. Sometimes we have synchronous communication, scheduled or by chance, but mostly communication is asynchronous, like ask a question and wait for response.</p>\n<p>Concerning the Build LibreCAD 3 task, if you want to battle this, I recommend to join our separate Zulip channel <a href=\"https://librecad.zulipchat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://librecad.zulipchat.com/\">https://librecad.zulipchat.com/</a>. Reach out for <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"138776\">@Kartik kumar</span>  or Florian. Kartik is GCI mentor too and Florian is our V3 maintainer.<br>\nBut you should at least have an idea how to use all the tools. Follow the instructions, install all needed dependencies and give it a go. Then, when any errors arise, ask for help on our Zulip channel.<br>\nConsider the Christmas holidays and turn of the year, responses may take longer these days.</p>",

Open Source is very much about working together, finding means and common motivation to work towards similar goals, or to at least work in a common space in related areas.  You have all made a lasting impression and given us months if not years of useful improvements that will benefit people all around the world.  Thank you.</p>",
