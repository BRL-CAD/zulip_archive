At a casual glance I'm not immediately seeing how they got from the winding number to the output mesh - the github code seems to not include that part, and the paper mentions something about  \"a continuation method [Wyvill et al. 1986] for voxelization and isosurface extraction.\"  That doesn't ring any bells for me - is it something you're familiar with?</p>",
