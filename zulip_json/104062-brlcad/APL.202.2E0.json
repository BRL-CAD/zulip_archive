There's a 2.0 version of the APSL, which might explain why Apple isn't keeping the  link from the old version active any more, but I wanted to check with you before updating to the 2.0 version to see if there were any issues with doing so.  If we do want to keep the older version of the Apple license, we'll just need to exclude that link from any eventual checking mechanism.</p>",

That code is related to auto-mounting the dmg which is entirely out-of-date but we've not pushed out mac binaries that way in a while, so I don't know what the new approach looks like yet.</p>",
