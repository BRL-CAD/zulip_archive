A real product would be more like this: <a href=\"https://github.com/drossberg/MOOSE\">https://github.com/drossberg/MOOSE</a></p>\n<p>The functionality is basically the same, but MOOSE uses more C++11 and builds (and installs) a brlcad library (<a href=\"http://libbrlcad.so\">libbrlcad.so</a>, brlcad.dll, ...) containing all necessary functions. In addition, other bindings could be added there. At the moment, it contains a raw Lua interface.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hey<br>\ni encountered an error while building this</p>",
