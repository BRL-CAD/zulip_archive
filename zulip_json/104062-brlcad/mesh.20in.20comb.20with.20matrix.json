When working with meshing in Goliath, I was seeing dark meshes that appear to be due to the faces being flipped.  After a lot of digging, I boiled down a case independent of the meshing itself:  <a href=\"http://brlcad.org/~starseeker/oflip.g\">http://brlcad.org/~starseeker/oflip.g</a></p>\n<p>What I'm seeing - both of these combs are using the same BoT solid, and placing it in different locations via matrices.  One of them shows the correct orientation in space, but the other is inside out.  The only thing I can figure is that the matrix is turning the mesh inside out when its being read in during the tree walk, but a) should it be able to do that at all and b) if that's OK, shouldn't we be detecting it somehow and flipping the orientation flag for the internal representation?</p>",
