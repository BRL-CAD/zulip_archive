In the previous code, MODEL_UNKNOWN was the mime type -- it was unknown because of the limitation/assumption that the input would be a 3D type yet we we're feeding images. We couldn't feed it a proper mime type.  But that's why I didn't understand what you meant about \"no other type\".</p>\n<p>That problem is/was fixed by flattening the namespace.

Only things I'm seeing that's maybe an issue is 1) whether it's worth keeping the 2nd-level grouping (e.g., image vs model vs ...) and if it's kept does this change break anything.  The lesser 2) issues is wanting to shorten/simplify the api symbols (e.g.,  bu_mime_t instead of bu_mime_context) so the default usage is more terse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>1st part done but not sure if it will break stuff because it didnt break the build atleast<br>\n2nd part was easy with a minor rename.</p>",
