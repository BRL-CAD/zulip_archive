Our old make_pkg and make_dmg scripts where both out of date (pkg more than dmg), but the biggest glaring omission is code signing.  The build is clean and is passing make test across the board (for 7.40.2 and latest).  Working now to sign the binaries+libs, pkg installer, and dmg, as well as what script or cmake updates we can make to help automate this.</p>",
