The work started a long while back to migrate to Github which included talking with them about our repo requirements as we far exceed their typical repository sizes.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112516\">@starseeker</span> is currently working on setting up a migration \"program\" that performs the conversion and helps with validation.  Preserving all of BRL-CAD's history properly is important, but it's fairly easy to know if a conversion is \"done correctly\" by checking that at least all the information we had in the repo is preserved.  His efforts to convert already found and has fixed a bug in the original cvs-to-svn migration that caused 1000+ commits to have the wrong timestamp.  What remains is making sure that all branches and tags are captured and reconstructed correctly, and getting some basic safeguards in place (e.g., so devs cannot delete history, accidentally or intentionally).</p>",
