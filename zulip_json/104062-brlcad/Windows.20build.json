You certainly have done well demonstrating competency with appleseed -- curious why you're not proposing to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71\">https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71</a> ?  Note that you don't need to involve appleseed to work on the neural intersection project -- the original vision there was an acceleration for rt_shootray() in LIBRT, not via BrlcadObject in the 'art' renderer.  The 'art' renderer does physically based rendering (i.e. MUCH more than intersection testing).</p>\n<p>I uploaded some materials that should be of assistance from the prior effort to <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/design/neural\">https://brlcad.org/design/neural</a> &lt;-- see if that helps understand the prior effort and what you might do next.  Also note, your experience with appleseed is just as interesting if not even more interesting, if <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71\">https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71</a> is of interest, given your demonstration.</p>",

On quick inspection it looks like the write up is reasonable but there alas won’t likely be time to go through it in detail until after the deadline.  But it looks good, like I said.  If you have not already, please do submit a code change (a pull request for something meaningful) soon as possible even if it’s after the deadline.  If you have already, do be sure to cite it in your proposal.  That’s arguably the most important aspect in evaluating any candidate’s proposal.</p>",
