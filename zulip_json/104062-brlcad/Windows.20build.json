You certainly have done well demonstrating competency with appleseed -- curious why you're not proposing to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71\">https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71</a> ?  Note that you don't need to involve appleseed to work on the neural intersection project -- the original vision there was an acceleration for rt_shootray() in LIBRT, not via BrlcadObject in the 'art' renderer.  The 'art' renderer does physically based rendering (i.e. MUCH more than intersection testing).</p>\n<p>I uploaded some materials that should be of assistance from the prior effort to <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/design/neural\">https://brlcad.org/design/neural</a> &lt;-- see if that helps understand the prior effort and what you might do next.  Also note, your experience with appleseed is just as interesting if not even more interesting, if <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71\">https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/71</a> is of interest, given your demonstration.</p>",

On quick inspection it looks like the write up is reasonable but there alas wonâ€™t likely be time to go through it in detail until after the deadline.  But it looks good, like I said.  If you have not already, please do submit a code change (a pull request for something meaningful) soon as possible even if itâ€™s after the deadline.  If you have already, do be sure to cite it in your proposal.  Thatâ€™s arguably the most important aspect in evaluating any candidateâ€™s proposal.</p>",
