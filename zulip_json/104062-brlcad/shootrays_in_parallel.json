I'm just not sure it's right book-keeping without some in-depth testing.  You're loop is centered around the nbits array becoming zero, so it may depend on how the caller initialized the initial threads and ray_num.  It's definitely on the right track for a semaphore-protected approach.  You do want to call rt_shootray outside of semaphore protection, otherwise the threads will all end up waiting on each other.</p>",
