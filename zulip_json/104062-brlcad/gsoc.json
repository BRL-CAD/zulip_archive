Once you get  familiar with the basic primitives and the workflow, it'll be easier to proceed further. Regarding the 'mouse click' approach, the annot primitive currently has a lot of issues relating to projections, scaling etc. Primary task should be to get rid of the bugs rather than focusing on the user experience.

I have been programming in C for a while, but I have not had the opportunity to work on any real world project so, I think this would be a great start. I generally have an interest in Algorithms and Data structures and I'm very open to learning.  I'm interested in the BRL-CAD annotation support enhancement project. I'll appreciate if I can be pointed to any microprojects that can help me better understand this project and also help setting up.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

Especially if you want to work on the kernel (as the annotation project would be), I recommend to start with learning how BRL-CAD works:</p>\n<p>Install BRL-CAD. You can find the necessary installation packages at <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/</a> This will install over 200 programs. Most of them are small command line tools. The most interesting for you are our old but still heavily used GUI mged and the more modern GUI archer. Go through the mged tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p>\n<p>To start with programming download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a> and compile and install the programs (<a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>).</p>\n<p>Regarding the annotations, you can create some in mged with <code>in &lt;object name&gt; annot ...</code> to see the current state of usability and explore how they are implemented, e.g. in src/librt/primitives/annot/annot.c.</p>",

So I am planning on making a new Python BRL-CAD module from scratch which will be compatible with Python3 and well documented.For this I am not sure if using ctypesgen will be beneficial or Tcl scripting ,can you help me on this? Right now I am doing research on this and will try to give you guys a proposal in a few days.</p>",

Welcome to our organization. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First you should start with installing the BRL-CAD programs. You can find the installation packages at <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/</a>. Go through the <strong>mged</strong> tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a> which is an old GUI where you will get to know how to create primitives, assign material properties, and ray tracing and many more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To start with programming download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a> and compile and install the programs (<a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>). You can use <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces</a> as a starter for small programming tasks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask. We will be happy to help.</p>",
