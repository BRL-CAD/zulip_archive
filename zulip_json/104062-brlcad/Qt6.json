We tend to stick with older standards until there's some compelling feature or need that motivates requiring the newer standards, since the shift means older platforms will cease to work with the newer versions.  The GUI (as opposed to the core) may opt for a different approach - we don't want to get stuck with an older Qt API when the newer one is available, and modern GUIs are usually problematic on older platforms anyway - but an across the board move to C++17 is probably not imminent.</p>",
