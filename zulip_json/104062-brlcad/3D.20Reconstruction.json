Had done the same with the TSDF pipeline some time back, but didn't use the disparity derived depth. Thanks to the TOF sensors in new gen smart phones.  :)</p>",

For example, scanning around something 360, the start points and end points end up misaligned.  Doesn't matter much at the resolution they're showing in the kitware demo, but it comes into play with bigger models (e.g., a car or room etc).  Impressive work regardless, looks fun to play with.</p>",
