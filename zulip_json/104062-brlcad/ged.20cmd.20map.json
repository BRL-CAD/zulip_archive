It's also a convenient way to detect any problems with the plugins at startup, so we can catch any errors in regression testing.  I'd want to make sure we preserve all those capabilities if we shift to on-the-fly lookup... </p>\n<p>(The only hard coded list is the exec_mapping.cpp file, and the purpose of that is to define the C functions for the libged programming API needed at compile time.)  </p>\n<p>I had initially envisioned the dynamic nature of the plugin mechanism as a way to extend the ged command set at run time - it's not implemented right now, but the libged_init would load the \"standard\" command set and then users could supply their own commands via plugin loading if they wanted to extend the command set...</p>",
