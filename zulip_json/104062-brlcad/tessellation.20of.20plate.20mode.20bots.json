Okay, a reason could be that there is no perfect boundary representation for these primitives, because the shape of the boundary depends on the viewing direction. But, the BREP is very important for the exchange with other CAD software, and there are so many models with plate mode bots out there, what creates the urge to do at least something.</p>\n<p>However, to start a discussion, I drafted an idea: <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/pull/181\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/pull/181</a><br>\nIt's not perfect, but better than nothing?</p>",

That's nominally what I'd typically expect on something randomly imported.  There's of course also value in extruding inwards/outwards so that the original triangle data is preserved exactly, in cases where the thickness is supposed to go in one direction.</p>",

Approach from left, it extends to right, approach from right, it extends to left. </p>\n<p>That's why I think centering makes for an \"okay\" compromise default, but then have an option in case they new the plate mode was a shell, for example, and the resulting behavior would be an inward extrusion.  Or maybe we test solidity and for solid manifolds we go inwards, otherwise it centers.</p>",
