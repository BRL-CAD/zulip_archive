Okay, a reason could be that there is no perfect boundary representation for these primitives, because the shape of the boundary depends on the viewing direction. But, the BREP is very important for the exchange with other CAD software, and there are so many models with plate mode bots out there, what creates the urge to do at least something.</p>\n<p>However, to start a discussion, I drafted an idea: <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/pull/181\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/pull/181</a><br>\nIt's not perfect, but better than nothing?</p>",
