Right now, it uses a non-blocking Tcl socket bridge to pipe geometry commands into a live MGED session. I hooked it up to an LLM via LangGraph, so I can literally just type something like \"make a 15mm cylinder and subtract it from that sphere,\" and the BRL-CAD GUI updates live with the boolean math. (Right now I've been playing with boolean operations and spheres, but could definitely index more tools with time).</p>\n<p>I know one of the long-term goals for BRL-CAD is improving the UX and lowering the learning curve. Letting users interact with the CSG engine using natural language feels like a really fun way to tackle that. Also, I noticed that tools like FreeCAD and OpenSCAD already have active MCP integrations out there, but BRL-CAD doesn't seem to have one yet. It feels like a missed opportunity to get BRL-CAD plugged into the new AI agent ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I'm really interested in applying for GSoC this year. I know an MCP integration isn't currently listed on the official problem statements, but would the mentors be open to considering a proposal around this? My goal for the summer would be to turn this Tcl socket prototype into a production-grade interface, perhaps integrated with the main GUI as a model-agnostic MCP interface with a BYOK system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/g1Rzxwcfzgyp6n153WVcRiue/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-24-at-20.44.18.mp4\">WhatsApp Video 2026-02-24 at 20.44.18.mp4</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image message_inline_video\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/g1Rzxwcfzgyp6n153WVcRiue/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-24-at-20.44.18.mp4\" title=\"WhatsApp Video 2026-02-24 at 20.44.18.mp4\"><video preload=\"metadata\" src=\"/user_uploads/1549/g1Rzxwcfzgyp6n153WVcRiue/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-24-at-20.44.18.mp4\"></video></a></div>",

Short answer is yes.</p>\n<p>Longer answer is that is something that I’ve been actively working and thinking about, albeit with manual scaffolding to explore how practical and effective it can be.  So yes you should definitely submit your ideas and we should continue to discuss.  The potential is tremendous for UX but also as a means for discovery and productivity.  The details of how and what skills/tools/features and data integrity will need to be developed as well.  </p>\n<p>Love custom ideas like this that align.</p>",
