They're currently thinking workshops to introduce students to BRL-CAD projects and dev practices, or partnering on specific student-to-mentor projects where we help mentor them on something.</p>\n<p>Who would be interested in supporting this collaboration, and in what capacity?  Thought it would be good to get a discussion going here first.  If there's anyone from UCSD listening, feel free to chime in as well.</p>",
