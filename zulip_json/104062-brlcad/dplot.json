Since brlcad_externals is moving us more towards a \"let the upstream handle it\" posture, perhaps that's ultimately the best option - I sure don't plan to check all of qtbase to see if anything in there is pre-generated :-/</p>",

Another victim of inadequate CI and testing.  Quite a lot of cases were working just fine so would be good to know what broke and when/why.
