Then my interest grew in designing and solid modeling. I have working knowledge of three different CAD softwares. And now I am involved in learning Robotics. I love to design Robots and currently working to design a smaller version of Industrial Robot.<br>\nSeeing a CAD organisation in GSoD has made me super enthusiastic to work here. I am new to open source. And in the past few days I have gone through the documentation of BRL - CAD and I am thinking of organising the existing documentation as my project for GSoD.

Two of my most recent publications in IEEE 3D Vision and IEEE TIPcould be found in <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yida_Wang/research\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yida_Wang/research\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yida_Wang/research</a>. I think that I'm good to work with \"writing a 'BRL-CAD Primitives' manual and organize developer docs\" proposal.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a video is also released on my personal website <a href=\"https://wangyida.github.io/publication/3dv18_wang/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wangyida.github.io/publication/3dv18_wang/\">https://wangyida.github.io/publication/3dv18_wang/</a> for 3D scene understanding topics. Apart from writing professional documents for BRL-CAD’s GSoD this year, I’m also interested to build a fancy website for BRL-CAD based on the similar framework as what I am using for my current 3D vision research <a href=\"https://wangyida.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wangyida.github.io/\">https://wangyida.github.io/</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Welcome to the community <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225944\">@Yida Wang</span> , I am an applicant as well. I recently joined this community. Looking forward to working with you :)</p>",
