Use <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a> for guidance. When you've explored its main features, you should download the source code (<a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/SVN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/SVN\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/SVN</a>) compile (<a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>) and install it. For some small development tasks you could look at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces</a>.</p>\n<p>However, it's worth to have a look at the whole BRL-CAD documentation: <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><br>\nThere is a page for newbies too: <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Tutorial/Newbie\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Tutorial/Newbie\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Tutorial/Newbie</a></p>",

What you could do is create a new combination, make the main group part of it, do the transformation, <code>xpush</code> it, and kill the new combination.</p>\n<p>I don't think that there will be much effort in developing mged (alone) any further. But, did you tried Archer?</p>",
