You'll either need to have them be specified with a count, eg.:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Text only\"><pre><span></span><code>in {name} {type} {entity} {count} {data}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Text only\"><pre><span></span><code>in foo sketch VL 5 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where we say we're going to read 5 vertices.</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p>you let them be specified with labels one at a time and you aggregate internally, eg.:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Text only\"><pre><span></span><code>in {name} {type} {entity} {data}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Text only\"><pre><span></span><code>in foo sketch VL 1 2 3 VL 1 2 3 VL 1 2 3 VL 1 2 3 VL 1 2 3\n</code></pre></div>",
