So whether it involves the arbalest repo or something else will be somewhat up to you and what you want to do.  As for our needs, working on the arbalest project is certainly one of the priority ways for getting involved.  There's also a code called 'qged' in the 'brlcad' repo that uses Qt that would benefit moving closer to how arbalest is doing things with OOP.  There's also a geometry V&amp;V gui that was build on arbalest that could use more work and is sort of a middle ground between arbalest and qged at the moment.</p>\n<p>For q#2, the best overview of the arbalest repo is the code itself.  It should be pretty self-explanatory as it adheres strongly to principles of encapsulation.  </p>\n<p>For q#3, sure that can suffice, but you will want to describe and demonstrate more than what we wrote to show that you both understand the problem and that you have a plan for how you'd implement the objectives you define.</p>",

I’m familiar with programs like Eagle and KiCad although it has been several years. I worked as a technician for 12 years, and I can design circuit boards from the ground up.

Well, we worked together for years, but continued collaboration and code sharing is the only concrete goal at the moment.  They've talked about having a BRL-CAD workbench in FreeCAD like they have for OpenSCAD, but nobody is currently working on that -- so that's something you could certainly try tackling. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t know a lot about parametric model coding, but I am willing to learn.

FreeCAD is mostly a parametric modeler (akin to Creo) whereas BRL-CAD is mostly a solid modeler (akin to NX, somewhat akin to Solidworks).  Understanding underlying geometry representations and the conversions needed and tradeoffs of the various representation schemes is a big piece of interoperability.</p>\n<p>Your experience is entirely relevant and I definitely appreciate and will be happy to support you learning whatever you need to learn to make progress.

It's a challenging but very fun effort with excellent visual results.  To get started, you'll want to learn as much as you can about physically-based rendering and where that support is in BRL-CAD.  You'll want to compile BRL-CAD with Appleseed enabled, which can be quite tricky to get working in itself, which will make an \"art\" executable that this project is all about getting working better by default.  If you get stuck, you can start by building BRL-CAD without Appleseed enabled (look at the cmake output to know if it's on or off) and learn the basics of converting and rendering a piece of geometry on the command-line.  You can also independently download Appleseed and learn how to use its raytracer to convert and render a piece of geometry.  That's all necessary background that \"should\" just take an hour or two, but can take days if you get stuck.  Feel free to ask follow- up questions in a \"PBR\" thread under <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"111975\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/111975-Google-Summer-of-Code\">#Google Summer of Code</a></p>",
