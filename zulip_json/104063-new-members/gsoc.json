I'm a MS Computer Science student at Columbia University  looking to get involved in graphics projects this summer. I'm comfortable working in C/C++, OpenGL, GLSL, etc and am familiar with graphics / animation concepts like path tracing, photon mapping, rigidbody physics, etc.  I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I'd love to get involved in GSoC! Right now, this issue (<a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/25\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/25\">https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/25</a>) on Appleseed Renderer Integration seems really interesting to me!</p>",

Start by installing BRL-CAD, install Appleseed, do the first couple MGED tutorials until you learn how to run \"rt\", render something in Appleseed, then check back in.  That should all just take you an hour or so at most.  Also, read this sequence of projects -- feel free to do them too as they will get you 90% there in just a couple hours:  <a href=\"https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/search/?q=appleseed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/search/?q=appleseed\">https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/search/?q=appleseed</a></p>",

It sounds like you have an excellent background for working the project in question so I look forward to talking with you more about the project.  The proposed project is essentially masters-level or even phd-level as a continuation and expansion of AMD's research paper.  Note that you are also able to propose a different project (AI-related or not) such as remeshing or anything -- we should just discuss whether it'd be a useful priority for BRL-CAD also.</p>\n<p>Our concern is definitely limited to static scenes.  However, they were focused only on recreating a specific view, and we would like to explore developing an encoding that works for arbitrary view points (arbitrary rays).</p>",

I would like to proceed with the research paper on AMD rather than proposing my own project. It appears to be a priority for you, and I am genuinely enthusiastic about this project. I enjoy improving rendering performance, and if it involves AI, that's even better. I read about a study in BRL-CAD conducted by Texas A&amp;M students. I would be interested in learning about the results of your study in order to propose a project.</p>",

Could you please provide some advice on my next steps?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>",

I'm most interested in the project Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) advanced shaders. I've taken advanced graduate level graphics class and have decent understanding of PBR. Additionally, I like exploring shaders. I've created sdf shaders, depth shaders, Blinn-Phong shaders before using GLSL and HLSL. Over the past few days I've installed  BRL-CAD and followed the tutorial. I'm working on the proposal right now and I may need some final touch advice before the deadline. Thank you so much and very excited!</p>",

It’s definitely an impactful project with a lot of potential.  There won’t be a lot of time to give you feedback and for you to work on a code submission, so best of luck to you on getting both done!  Feel free to post any specific technical questions, if you have them.  The biggest factor at this point is going to be the code submission and having a reasonable plan to reflects your ability.</p>",
