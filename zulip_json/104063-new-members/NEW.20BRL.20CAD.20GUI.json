Then let's directly start with building brlcad <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>. Once your build is successful, try mged tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>, so that you can decide which features you can bring it in to our arbalest. For building Arbalest, you need to build moose and then arbalest. Arbalest is built upon moose. <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/MOOSE\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/MOOSE</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/arbalest\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/arbalest</a></p>",
