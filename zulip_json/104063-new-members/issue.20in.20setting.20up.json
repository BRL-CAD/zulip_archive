Not going to lie, getting Appleseed up and running from source is not simple.  Now note, you <em>CAN</em> get the build working with an already-compiled version of Appleseed so you might want to try that instead of compiling from source.  The setup is quite a bit easier.  You should not need to use WSL even -- BRL-CAD's art compilation with Appleseed works compiled via Visual Studio, and it comes with all the requisite dependencies.  These instructions provide a helpful walk-through:  <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Appleseed\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Appleseed</a></p>",
