You can find the necessary installation packages at <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases</a>. This will install over 200 programs. Most of them are small command line tools. The most interesting for you are our old but still heavily used GUI mged and the more modern GUI archer. Go through the mged tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.</p>\n<p>To start programming, download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a>, compile, and install the programs (<a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>).</p>",

Welcome to our organization. If you're going to build brlcad in windows then just download the repo from github and install cmake, visual studio. Open cmake and provide src path and build path. Hit configure button 2 times then hit generate button. Then open the project. After opening, you can build it by opening cmake predefined targets and you will see <code>ALL_BUILD</code>. Then start building it.</p>",
