Welcome to our organization. If you're going to build brlcad in windows then just download the repo from github and install cmake, visual studio. Open cmake and provide src path and build path. Hit configure button 2 times then hit generate button. Then open the project. After opening, you can build it by opening cmake predefined targets and you will see <code>ALL_BUILD</code>. Then start building it.</p>",

I’m  David Uzor, a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Georgia, passionate about 3D graphics, computer-aided technologies (CAx), and AI-driven tools<strong>. My tech stack includes </strong>Python, C/C++, Java, Blender (3D modelling, ray tracing), OpenGL, and web development tools like Svelte and Spring Boot**. I’ve been exploring Blender since January 2024, diving into UV editing, texture mapping, and Python scripting. I’m excited about BRL-CAD’s work in solid geometry, ray tracing, and high-performance computing. While I know applications open in two days and I should’ve reached out earlier, I’d love to contribute to your projects and learn more about where to start!</p>",

If you have experience with UVs and texture mapping, one particular potential project of interest would be to propose finishing the implementation of texture mapping support for BoTs in BRL-CAD.
