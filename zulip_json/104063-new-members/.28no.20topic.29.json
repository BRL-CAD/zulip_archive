It sounds like you have some background relevant for the neural rendering project.  The next steps will be to climb the learning curve to understand BRL-CAD better so you can write an appropriately scoped proposal.  Towards that end, I suggest compiling BRL-CAD from source checkout (see <a href=\"http://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>), and do some of the modeling tutorials available on the website (various on <a href=\"http://brlcad.org/wiki/Documentation\">brlcad.org/wiki/Documentation</a> under MGED/modeling tutorials).</p>",
