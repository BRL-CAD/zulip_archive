The interesting part can be found in the docs (wiki) there: <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p>\n<p>To familiarize yourself with our software, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install BRL-CAD. You can find binary packages for Windows at <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases</a>. This will install over 200 programs. Most of them are small command line tools. The most interesting for you are our old but still heavily used GUI mged and the more modern GUI archer.</li>\n<li>Go through the mged tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>. The tutorial will show you how to create geometries, assign materials, create ray-trace images, and many more.</li>\n</ul>",
