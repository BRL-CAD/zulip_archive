It's also said it's recommended to submit some patches and join the IRC channel. It's better this chat or the IRC channel to discuss the topic? Thanks!</p>",

For the IRC you have to be online (or a running chat process, e.g. in something like <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/screen\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/screen\">screen</a>) to receive the answer.
