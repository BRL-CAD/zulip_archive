        "content": "<p>I see many new signups here and I suppose, most of them think about contributing to BRL-CAD in this years GSoC. Welcome to our organization. Before you can start contributing, you should familiarize yourself with the software package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with installing BRL-CAD. You can find installable packages at <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/</a>. These aren't the most current versions, but good enough for your first steps.</li>\n<li>Go through the mged tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>. Mged is the legacy GUI. The tutorial will show you how to create primitives, assign material properties, ray tracing, and many more.</li>\n<li>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.</li>\n<li>To start with programming, download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a>, compile, and install the programs (<a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>). You can use <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces</a> as a starter for small programming tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Google Summer of Code, you have to propose the programming project you want to do this summer. You can find some ideas <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22GSoC+2023%22+label%3A%22Project%3A+BRL-CAD%22\">here</a>, but you may propose an own idea too. There are many more ideas on our website (see the third bullet above ;).</p>\n<p>If you want to apply for GSoC with BRL-CAD, you should follow our <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Application_Guidelines\">application guidelines</a>. Examples from past years can be found <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask. We will be happy to help.</p>",

I.e.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Install the main programs. You can find installation binaries for Windows among the releases <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases</a>. If you don't want to start with Windows, you have to compile the programs by yourself first. For doing this, see next section.<br>\nThe installation contains a huge amount of programs. Most of them are small command line tools. You should look at our old but still heavily used GUI <strong>mged</strong> and the more modern GUI <strong>archer</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With both, you can go through the tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Gain an overview of the existing documentation at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next step would be compiling the programs from sources. This is, of course, necessary for contributing to the programs in our main repository. But, even if you are interested in web-programming, like our <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor\">Online Geometry Viewer</a> or writing a Python API (where you need an installed BRL-CAD only), without being able to compile it by yourself, you cannot benefit from latest improvements. Therefore</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad</a>.</li>\n<li>Compile, and install the programs (see <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Links with ideas for small contributions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Deuces</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/BUGS\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/BUGS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/TODO\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/TODO</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last, some remarks regarding GSoC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GSoC is not a simple paid programming. You won't get a list of functions you have to implement. Rather, you have to propose your own short (approx. 3 months) software development project. I.e., you are your own project manager. Of course, you get help making the plan and carrying it out.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/labels/Project%3A%20BRL-CAD\">This</a> are some ideas for GSoC projects. GSoC 2025 however hasn't started and we haven't decided about participation, priorities, etc. yet.</li>\n</ul>",
