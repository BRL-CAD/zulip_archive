I personally feel that they are a great alternative to the initial project by kanzure and seem to be rather simple and straight forward to use. What're your views for the same? <br>\nHow it works is, It creates a tcl file, then sends it to mged which then creates and populates a .g file database,  the .g file is then converted with g-stl to produce an STL file.<br>\nI'm going through the code to have a clearer picture of how it works (shouldn't take very long though).<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nmz787/python-brlcad-tcl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nmz787/python-brlcad-tcl\">https://github.com/nmz787/python-brlcad-tcl</a></p>",
