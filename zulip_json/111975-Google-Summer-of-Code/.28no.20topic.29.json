The mentors are listening and will engage when you do some work and ask smart questions.  Please avoid honorifics as they are counterproductive.   Read <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works\">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works</a> to better understand what you're supposed to do.  You write a project proposal.  We have published some ideas but those are just ideas.  In addition to your project proposal, you need to familiarize yourself with the code (get it to compile, get it to run, do some tutorials).  That will help you write a useful and educated project proposal.  You have to do the work -- it is not given to you.</p>",
