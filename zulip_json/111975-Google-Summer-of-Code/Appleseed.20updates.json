You present a reasonable plan and I like the itemization of approach.  It would be nice to see more detail about Appleseed in there, what your plan of attack is with respect to Appleseed's actual codebase and integrations.  It would also be useful to see a specific timeline with approximate milestone objects for each week of the weeks of the proposed duration.  You talk almost exclusively about lib2to3 and the 2to3 tool, but the project will require more than that like build system changes, testing (which you do mention), and it will vary from integration to integration to appleseed's codebase.  It'd be help to see some evidence in your writeup that you've researched the Appleseed codebase well enough to formulate a specific plan itemizing what your'e going to do to the code.  Keep up the nice work and look forward to seeing how you can address those concerns.</p>",
