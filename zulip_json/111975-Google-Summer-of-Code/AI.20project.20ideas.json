BRL-CAD just completed a pretty big one just last semester with Texas A&amp;M University doing neural rendering, and I'm thinking to propose its continuation as a GSoC project.  As such, I do intend to mark our org as having AI project(s).</p>\n<p>Towards that end, it would likely be beneficial to have more than one in our project list.  If you do have an AI topic you'd be willing to mentor, please mark it in the title as \"AI\" very clearly and adding an AI tag.</p>\n<p>To be clear, you don't have to have AI projects, but having one in your list certainly won't hurt...and might help.</p>",

Mass-firing last year notwithstanding...</p>\n<p>As for the AI orgs, they do still have to be open source communities as before -- it sounded more like they want to make sure Google is supporting/inviting the various AI communities to participate like Pytorch, <a href=\"http://Fast.ai\">Fast.ai</a>, Keras, Theanos, scikit-learn, OpenNN, etc.  Tensorflow and OpenCV (and maybe Pytorch) have been involved in GSoC for many many years already, but many others not so much.</p>\n<p>Also, don't know if the AI push was from internal-to-OSPO management or at some level higher -- that wasn't stated.  What I do know is that GSoC has now been under threat of cancellation for several years now and microchanges have helped sustain the program.  Expanding to allow game projects was one of the first changes I helped push.  Expanding to non-notable research projects. <br>\n Expanding to more than students.  Expanding to different sized projects.  Ensuring there's an equitable inclusion of AI projects doesn't seem terribly dissimilar to me.</p>\n<p>GSoC's original goal was \"flip bits, not burgers\" -- a summer job for college kids to get involved in select open source communities.</p>",

Indeed, it could be argued that by encouraging open source focus on AI they're trying to help open source projects and software avoid losing ground to closed source systems.</p>",
