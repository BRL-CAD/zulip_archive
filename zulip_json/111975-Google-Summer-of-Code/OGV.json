Before I edited the landing page, that model would default to an error, which previously just was an image which was not centered and didnt have any CSS or style properly attached to it.</p>\n<p>What I am suggesting is that I move the model loading error towards another issue relating to model loading and proper model style to make more progress on that front. </p>\n<p>1) The landing page model SRC does not load whatsoever and defaults to error, it would be better to just not have it there because it doesnt actually load any model</p>\n<p>2) Before I started working on the 404 issue and even now, the 404 page is currently error.js in routing, I have to create a 404.js or something similiar and reroute the routing from error.js to the new file for 404.js and fix the model loading file error.js , to me this is a very different issue not related to fixing the original issue which is the \"low hanging\" issue of <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/issues/72\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/issues/72\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/issues/72</a> which just wants to fix the link on the 404 page..</p>\n<p>I want to let you know I have been working hard on this and I really hope you understand :(</p>",

Doing that can easily result in frustration because different people are going to be focusing on different issues.  For example, issue #72 is simply about a link not working.  Does PR #89 fix that issue without causing any other problems or side effects?  If not, then there should probably be a different issue created  for PR #89 or a different PR submitted in response to issue #72.</p>\n<p>I don't think anyone would argue against separating 404 errors from other types of errors.  ;)</p>",

My PR also went through revisions when I was a GSoC student. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I understand what you were telling me, what I am trying to emphasize and communicate to you is that the Error.html template is connected to error.js which in iron-router is currently connected to the 404 page for the website and the model error at the same time..</p>\n<p>I have to go into iron-router and revamp the route for the model loading error so it is seperate from the 404 page which requires me to go into the model loading code and change it so it is seperate. To me this seems related to the other model loading error issues</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that's the part of the issue. You combined the model loading error and 404 error in the same template. That's why we are getting a 404 page embedded inside the box where the model was supposed to load. That's the reason we have a separate template for both errors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2) Before I started working on the 404 issue and even now, the 404 page is currently error.js in routing, I have to create a 404.js or something similiar and reroute the routing from error.js to the new file for 404.js and fix the model loading file error.js</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what I was trying to tell. You don't have to create a new file/template. There is a file already in OGV source code. I pointed out the exact path in the PR conversation. Just use it to show 404 template instead of error template in the routing file. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The original issue mentions of fixing the link on the 404 page, in order to actually see the edits I made to the 404 page because of the problem mentioned above I had to paste it into error.js because by Default the error.js file is routing to the 404 page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that is true. This is what I have told you earlier. And you commented the following on Github</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(In PR conversation, you left this comment) <br>\nI am going to revert these changes and fix the 404.html template instead and the routing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the above comment, I thought, we are on the same page on how to fix it.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you still have doubts on how to fix this, and we can talk about it.</p>",

So for sending email verifications, we need \"admin\" account to have email server setup in settings. Currently, even when admin account does not have an email server setup, other users can reach login/sign up forms, fill it but they never receive a verification email (hence never able to sign up). What we want is, that we should not allow any user to reach and fill sign up form until admin has set its email server in settings.</p>\n<p>Doing this would be a very minor code change, and this bug comes only for a small amount of time before admin signs up. So it's a semi-edge case scenario. I think you can see how it's not that important or urgent (as compared to other issues on the list).</p>\n<p>Regarding freedom: Yes Quentin, you have the freedom (as long as we are looking in issues under scope of GSoC) .

Meanwhile, I was understanding the flow of the backend as well. So that I can make myself aware of possible breaking changes. Both are very different. Anyway, I got stuck in the backend part first. Integrating the new package on the front-end is not a big deal but handling the pub/subs with the CFS framework is a bit different. Now I'm at the place where I can see the files are getting saved in the directory, the file information is getting saved in Mongo collection though there is some information that is not getting updated on the database. Today I will complete the uploading of the obj file, save the information of the file in the mongo collection database and test this thing. If this will work as expected the rest of the features like uploading profile pictures and MTL files uploading would be similar. I hope that won't take much longer.</p>",

Handling sessions is not trivial. Let the framework (nest.js?) do it for you. Keeping C++ objects as part of a session handle is usually a bad idea. Put every state information in framework objects, which are considered to hold session data. Hand them over to a BRL-CAD program, run this program in an own process, and return the result to the framework.</p>\n<p>If you need a bridge to use the system API, prefer C over C++. E.g., write a C function, which does the operation behind a button in the GUI, based on the data given. This function can use C++ stuff to to its work, that's okay. Then, you could put all of these functions in a library and bridge it to the framework. However, these functions should all be stateless.</p>",

In my mind, we're trying to create crazy-simple sharing of geometry and geometry conversions in a spirit similar to (but not the same as) the pastebin services of old.
