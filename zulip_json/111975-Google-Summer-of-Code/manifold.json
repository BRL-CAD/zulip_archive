The legal and tax implications sending money is incredibly complicated (even domestically, but especially internationally -- it took 4 months and over a hundred hrs effort to send money to an EU contributor a couple years ago).  I started a non-profit to help address that with suborgs, but that is even more time-consuming and not fully established for sending internationally.</p>\n<p>What we have done in the past is allocated funds for sending additional mentors to the mentor summit.

The general expectations to be aware of definitely vary from project-org to project-org.  </p>\n<p>Regarding projects:  In general, you will have autonomy on projects you propose and mentor, though projects that enable or benefit multiple code bases are encouraged.  You'll need to make sure your ideas have very clear, general-population-friendly titles -- detail and domain-specific terminology can go in the description.  Projects need to have a mentor designated (more on that below).</p>\n<p>Proposals: What's not entirely in your control is what proposals are received as they need to be high quality.  You are encouraged to solicit proposals through any means available (e.g., invite local universities or interest groups).  Proposals with little effort invested invariably result in poor experiences.  That is to say, if you get a proposal for topic X and even if that's your only proposal received, if it's not a \"great\" write-up (i.e., the person half-assed the submission) or if the person never joins chat or other red flags, it would get disqualified.  That's to say there is an overarching quality metric that all proposals need to satisfy before they are valid for ranking consideration.  We typically get 4-12 slots and the goal is accepting at least one per partner, but it does depend on the number of proposals received, how many we got last year, and Google's funding level.</p>\n<p>New Org:  As a new org, you're not allowed to have more than two slots, default may be just one depending on the quality and variety of proposals received -- that's a Google rule that we must also enforce.</p>\n<p>Mentor summit: Veteran mentors that have not been recently typically get priority for the summit but it depends on availability, and if we can get additional mentors approved.   We typically get 1-3 delegates (all expenses are paid by Google and our org).</p>\n<p>Stipends: We don't give stipends to individual mentors.  We've discussed directing funds to partner org organizations/foundations, but even that is proving to be complex form a tax code perspective.  We can discuss more if needed, but typically it's asked that orgs just let the funds go towards overhead expenses like summit travel, books, stickers, servers, etc.  I would love help if anyone is interested in getting our non-profit more organized and structured (e.g., how to incroporate membership and decision-making) since that's really what is needed at this point to enable fundraising/fundspending without so much complexity.</p>\n<p>Mentors:  There's a lot of great information on Google's sight on what is expected of mentors, so they should all definitely read that information.  I helped write them, and there's even a couple videos with yours truly.  The general guideline we impose is that mentors should have (on average) about 10 hours a week available for mentoring.  That will be potentially more during evaluations, but more is better as that results in engagement and contributors that stick around.</p>\n<p>Probation and Failure:  I do ask that all participants maintain a public dev log that is watched to ensure consistency of experience and equity across all participants.  If a participant doesn't appear to be working, there is a probationary process where the admin (myself or Daniel) may step in and take over mentoring, to impose additional requirements prior to failing them, or to help reassign mentoring if there is an interpersonal situation.  Super rare for us, but it happens.</p>\n<p>Communications:  Work is expected to be completed fully in the open somewhere (including discussions), e.g., IRC, Zulip, Discord, etc.  You can also have face-to-face / video meetings, or can be entirely online -- just not via private e-mail.  </p>\n<p>That's all I can think off the top of my head.... any questions?   Anything I missed?</p>",
