Initially again i tried to create hrt which gave the same error of major-value not initiallised, then i solved that issue and again tried to create a new hrt and this time it work.</p>\n<p>the function was not working for link 1 as the \"slides\" was randomly getting initialised to -2,147,483,647, i tried to follow the trail but was not able to figure out why initially it was getting assigned (the variable \"slides\" of rt_ell function) to -2,147,483,647 and now it was not.</p>\n<p>If a wild guess is allowed, what i can say that is as initially (still assuming) as i had download the repository from a link which is ment to run on a virtual machine, i was getting a segmentation fault as i was not running it on a virtual machine and now with the proper link i was just able to fix hrt as well as i did it for annot.</p>\n<p>If this above made assumption is correct we need to state that link mentioned on this wiki <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a> is ment for running brlcad on virtual machine.</p>\n<p>I guess, the reply turned to be to long, but will help us to get the complete picture.</p>",

I said usually because these values can be altered by transformations given in the compinations.</p>\n<p>However, the annotation primitive lives at a different coordinate system: The screen or paper system.

With their symbols, they are obviously conform with a standard, but it's hard to believe that this standard allows skewness or arbitrary letter size. These images only make sense with one or more paper planes for blueprints with associated scales behind.</p>\n<p>As \"paper plane\" and \"scale\" are usual entities in a CAD, there are no adequate objects in BRL-CAD for expressing them. That's why for the first implementation of annotations in BRL-CAD the <em>natural</em> paper plane and scale was chosen: The current display plane and scale.</p>\n<p>I.e., the annotations size shall be its size on the screen. The annotation shall always be displayed at the same size and front-on on the screen. Unfortunately, this doesn't work with OpenGL and therefore on Windows yet. I would expect that displaying annotations had to work somehow similar to displaying the faceplate in mged with OpenGL.</p>",

For the bonding period, I encourage you to ask as many questions as possible, read the code, get your development environment set up, and maybe try a few of the mged tutorials.  That will give you some basic that help with understanding how to create, visualize, and edit annotation objects. </p>\n<p>For what it's worth, you can do all your development on Windows but just realize that you may end up needing to fix things there as several of the other devs don't like doing that as frequently as it's required, myself included.  If you have trouble getting Linux set up, let me know and we can get you an account set up on another system. </p>\n<p>As for what specifically you need to do in the bonding period, there's a nice checklist for you at <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Checklist\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Checklist\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Checklist</a></p>",

This includes the wrong depiction with OpenGL, for example on Windows.<br>\nNext, you would need to extend the data structure by references. When you want to display symbols and texts side by side, you need a way to say something like \"from the right border of the segment with id xxx go 2 mm to the right and then display this segment there\".</p>\n<p>When you are able to do this, very much of what's in <a href=\"https://www.3dcadworld.com/leveraging-3d-cad-data/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.3dcadworld.com/leveraging-3d-cad-data/\">https://www.3dcadworld.com/leveraging-3d-cad-data/</a> can be seen could be done.

There could be different in commands for mged and archer which make it easier to create annotations for different uses, but the core of the annotation will always be a segment list <code>rt_annot_internal-&gt;ant-&gt;segments</code>. This list consists of any number of segments with type line_seg, carc_seg, nurb_seg, bezier_seg, and txt_seg. Now, it would be on you to write a general input method for any of these sequences. Maybe because the annotation is similar to the sketch, the code for the sketch primitive may provide some help here.</p>",

We'll want annotations that are both static and dynamic, e.g., a linear dimension that updates as the thing it is pointed to changes in size.

This function calls then a <code>static int bn_vlist_bbox_internal(struct bn_vlist *vp, point_t *bmin, point_t *bmax, int *disp_mode)</code> which is mainly the current bn_vlist_bbox() function.

The main issue is a compilation warning/error because of the unused variable mybnlist. Other findings are:<br>\n* There are many empty lines before and after the includes in bn_vlist.c. Are they really necessary? It looks like 1 or 2 lines are usual.<br>\n* <code>#include \"rt/global.h\"</code>, <code>struct rt_g RTG ;</code> and <code>BU_LIST_INIT(&amp;RTG.rtg_vlfree);</code> shouldn't be necessary any more. RTG is generally unused.<br>\n* There are a lot of lines which contain only spaces in bn_vlist.c. An empty line shouldn't contain additional spaces. There is an option in Visual Studio to visualize the space characters.<br>\n* The source files shall end with a new-line.<br>\n* One empty line between the two bn_test blocks is enough in CMakeLists.txt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will fix them all thank you. but the linking error which was RTG unresolved external is fixed only by rt_g RTG; and the BU_assert error is fixed by BU_LIST_INIT(&amp;RTG.rtg_vlfree) why do you think they are not necessary? you can see in the global.h line 53 <br>\n/**<br>\n * Applications that are going to use RT_ADD_VLIST and RT_GET_VLIST<br>\n * are required to execute this macro once, first:<br>\n *<br>\n * BU_LIST_INIT(&amp;RTG.rtg_vlfree);<br>\n *<br>\n * Note that RT_GET_VLIST and RT_FREE_VLIST are non-PARALLEL.<br>\n */</p>",

We just need to make sure they're consistent, documented somewhere, and won't cause a problem.
