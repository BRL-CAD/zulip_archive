I'd certainly encourage you to take a look at integrating the wireframe, just to not get too distracted with it just yet.  The code is in src/libdm/dm-qt.cpp, enabled when Qt is detected and enabled during CMake.  So you'll want to install Qt and make sure CMake finds it (and says so in the summary), which might take some tweaking or minor code updates.</p>\n<p>So it's a double-edged sword -- IF you can get a (libdm) display manager integrated and working in a Qt GUI, you will get nearly instant access to (shaded) triangle mesh and wireframe drawing like you see in mged automatically.  That said, the libdm code is typically hard code to comprehend and debug, so there's a learning curve and you very well might make faster progress doing something new using Qt3D, but then having to replicate some of the code in libdm for getting geometry representations.  As Daniel mentioned, coreInterface has an API for getting triangles, though, so you could simply start with that if you like the clean slate approach.  Start with libdm if you want the more featureful but harder approach.</p>\n<p>For your proposal, I suggest you keep it as simple as possible, low risk, modular, so things can be updated/replaced if desired later, but always functional.

You'll see this directly if you run the \"in\" command.  It will prompt you for each parameter based on the type of object you try to make.</p>\n<p>ELL is created via three vectors.  ELL1 is created with 1 vector and a radius.  Both result in an ELL object, only difference is how they were created.</p>\n<p>What this does raise is there possibly needing to be some way to have alternative ways for specifying parameters later, but it's out of scope for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3) Regarding our discussion about wireframes/rendering.<br>\nWithout implementing this it is impossible to implement any editing. (other than property changes through properties panel). Even position/rotation changing will have to be delayed. Anyway in the proposal I'm putting the wireframe thing and everything that depends on it towards the later weeks.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having some visual representation of geometry is kind of central to a GUI, more important than editing.  It's okay to defer or have a placeholder for \"draw geometry here\" at first, but once there are buttons and panels that will quickly be a necessity to ensure everything is getting wired up correctly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4) In dm-qt.cpp<br>\nIs the only reason tk and tcl stuff are in the code, because the whole rectangular graphics window is placed inside a Tk window?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes.  As it is a Tk window, Tk also handles that window's key and mouse events.  In a pure Qt context, that is all bypassed (qt_open_existing()).</p>\n<p>By the way, check out <a href=\"http://brlcad.org/design/gui/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://brlcad.org/design/gui/\">http://brlcad.org/design/gui/</a> if you haven't already.

The GUI doesn't support the creation of the sphere! You could do the same with mged in <em>nu</em> mode, maybe even faster, because you don't have to change between keyboard and mouse. From a CAD GUI you can expect that it helps you to determine the center and radius (and the name) of the sphere. For example, to do the goblet in the tutorial you want to place the spheres for the stem by clicking on the places where you want to create them on the screen.</p>\n<p>Which are the steps one had to do for this? I recommend to go this way:<br>\n* Creation of a mock-up GUI: It shows the intended layout and functioning, but it isn't connected to any BRL-CAD core function yet.<br>\n* Opening, saving, and closing of BRL-CAD database files: Here starts the connection with BRL-CAD functions. It should be easy to implement, but already arise a question about the GUIs behavior.<br>\n* Displaying the geometry on the screen: This is one of the big points, which requires some work. I'm thinking at a wire-frame depiction here. The lines could be taken from the tessellation or the plot functions (I would prefer the plot functions). Did you thought of having GUI elements for shifting, rotating, and zooming the view in the first step?<br>\n* Determining model points under screen points: When the user clicks on the screen, which point does they mean?<br>\n* Creation of a sphere: After having all the above done, this shouldn't be so complicated any more.<br>\n* A preview of the sphere during its creation: When the center of the new sphere is determined, a circle which moves with the mouse should help the user to imagine how this new sphere looks like with the other geometric elements.</p>\n<p>Well, if you are able to create a sphere with your GUI at the end of GSoC you are good <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",

My doubts start with your argumentation with the \"2D Qt plane\" and 3D OpenGL environment\". Maybe, you don't know what OpenGL does: Computing 2D raster images from 3D input data. I.e., you need to consider the 2D display plane there as well. What complicates it is, that you need to translate the BRL-CAD transformation an display logic into the OpenGL \"language\". This isn't trivial, see the annotation bug thread here for example.</p>\n<p>If you know what you are doing and how to say it in OpenGL, it can be a powerful tool to accelerate the graphic routines, because a good OpenGL driver will do many of the computations on the graphic card.</p>\n<p>Lightning, textures, etc. are another issue, were OpenGL is hard to use, because BRL-CAD has its own renderer with algorithmic generated textures, for example.

As already mentioned, graphic libraries as OpenGL take their power from shifting a large part of the computational work to the video card. To be effective, as much data as possible hast to be stored there too. You may have heard that there is memory for textures on a video card. The display lists are chunks of the model or CAD data, reduced to simple primitives (often triangles), which can be stored on the video card and used there without bothering the CPU or RAM again.</p>\n<p>For example, for the wire-frame view, you could put all the edges from the BRL-CAD model in a huge edge list as a display list, and store it on the video card. If you zoom, shift, or rotate the view now, you have to readjust the camera only and send the command for redrawing the stored display list.</p>",

So I'm struggling to allocate as much time on this as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is understandable and will certainly be a challenge for you.  In particular, it's going to be a time management challenge until at least the 17th.  I suggest you dedicate some part of your day at a specific schedule, like 4 hours a day from 9am-11am and 6-8pm 4-5 days a week, something like that instead of trying to burst a whole 8-10 hours one day and then nothing for 2-3 days because you're now behind on studying for some exam.  If we see you making even a little bit of activity and actual progress every day, that will be reassuring.  Then you can adjust your schedule after exams are over to make up lost time (e.g., 50-60 hour weeks for 3-4 weeks).  What doesn't work and gets you on a trouble radar is when you do nothing for 3+ days.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1) Doesn't rt in librt stand for RayTrace? If so why are things like db open and vlist generation in it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It does stand for ray tracing.  Originally the database functions were actually colocated in librt for low-level performance reasons.  Those reasons, however, no longer matter so there are plans to extract them into their own \"libg\" for the .g file format.  As for vlist generation, that's a property of objects, which also belongs to the individual primitives (they must describe themselves in a wireframe form, in textual form, in raytrace form, etc).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2) 'RT^3' what does this mean?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"RT cubed\" is simply the name of the repository holding some \"next generation\" plans for BRL-CAD.  In mathematical terms, to cube something is to multiply it three times (e.g., 8^3 = 8 * 8 * 8 = 512).  Other than a fun mathematical project name, it has no other implication.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3) Was coreinterfaces and qt gui developed as parts of the  same project?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They were developed independently but added to the rt^3 repository as that's where \"next generation\" code projects have been worked on.</p>",

It doesn't contain all necessary methods, checks, etc..</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"102939\">@Daniel Rossberg</span> ,  would this not slow things down instead of making things faster? <br>\nI had actually considered doing this but then decided against it due to the following reason. Think of the 2 scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1</strong> - We call opengl methods inside <code>Iterate()</code><br>\nEach time the opengl scene is redrawn we need to call  <code>Iterate</code>. In each call all elements in <code>m_vlist</code> are used to build C++ class instances. A single call to <code>Iterate</code> costs approximately the time taken to clone a list (if implemented) that contains all the <code>Elements</code>.<br>\nEach time the geometry is changed we need to call  <code>Plot</code>. In this call <code>m_vlist</code> is built.</p>\n<p>Total cost in a session  =  (# OpenGL redraws * costs for <code>Iterate</code>) + (# geometry edits * cost for <code>Plot</code>)</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2</strong> - We generate and save the list of all elements when <code>Plot</code> is called and keep using that same list for drawing until geometry is changed again.</p>\n<p>Total cost in a session  =    # geometry edits * (cost for <code>Plot</code>  +  costs for <code>Iterate</code>+ cost to clone the list)</p>\n<p>Cost to clone the list can be avoided if supported by coreinterfaces (e.g allocated on heap)</p>\n<p>The big difference between the cost happens in the way it is used in practice. (# OpenGL redraws) is hugely higher than (# geometry edits). This is because most of the time users navigate the 3d space. Even when a user rotates opengl camera by 90 degrees, if it goes smoothly there will be 100 frames for that move itself. But for an entire 30 minutes session he would only do less than 100 edits to the geometry. Putting the overhead of generating C++ instances from m_vlist to every opengl draw frame IMO is more costly since it is roughly the cost to clone the list.</p>\n<p>Maybe we can optimize case 2 further by doing m_vlist &gt; c++ classes conversion only for changes geometry .</p>\n<p>Not sure I understood stuff correctly.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"102939\">@Daniel Rossberg</span></p>",

Yes, they are a property of geometry.  There are a variety of rules for how colors work.  The summary is that there are essentially three ways an object gets a color.</p>\n<p>First and most simple is an object can have a color specified directly on that object.  This is stored as an attribute on the object.</p>\n<p>Second, an object can inherit a color from a parent object.  For example, say you have some \"engine\" object and way down the hierarchy there is a \"bolt\".  We can set a color on engine and bolt can inherit the color when it's displayed in the context of an engine.  In this manner, bolt will not have a color if it's displayed by itself (i.e., NOT in context of an engine).</p>\n<p>Third, an object's color may come from a global color table.  For regions and object belonging to a region, they have a numeric identifier set on them as an attribute (e.g., regionID is \"1000\").  The color table can specify all objects 1000-3000, for example, are rgb 255/0/0.</p>\n<p>There is not a succinct function to get an object's color, but you can find the core logic in a few places throughout the code.  The cleanest appears to be in src/libged/display_list.c, start with the color_soltab() function.</p>",

It encapsulate the necessary memory management for the creation of object paths in a class. That's fine.</p>\n<p>If there are better ways to access the objects depends on which information do you want to get and how much do you want to compute by yourself. With the Combination object you have access to all available information. It contains the complete Boolean tree with the operations and transformations.

You could show the \"Show Matrix\" button for these entries only.</p>\n<p>For me, it would be more interesting to see the tree structure of the combination with its Boolean operations.</p>\n<p>BTW, you make still extensive use of <strong>auto</strong>, but I think, you shouldn't use it unless it really makes sense. If an inexperienced reader sees it, they don't know the type of the variable. In addition, it makes it hard to find the places where a distinct type is used (e.g. with grep). Reading through some articles discussing this issue, I got the impression, that people who know the code (classes, API used there) find it a reasonable way to make the code more readable, for every body else it makes the source code a riddle.</p>",

Probably as part of MOOSE (i.e. part of the larger API that includes coreInterface's OO hierarchy).  It could be attached as a method on a Database object, but the GUI needs more access and control in order to automatically update views and such, so probably not there.

Like in mged there are too much options that are not found in arbalest yet. I have listed some of the feature that are not yet in arbalest which are the following:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Alert box is missing that shows title after opening a .g file. There should be way to give title to a file? If this feature implemented then either it can be displayed in a bar which is currently showing the file path or when I hover mouse on the name of the tab . Or any suggestion?<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/dvor-3pX7b9eeCXSx8vBT0Dh/Screenshot-26_LI.jpg\">title.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/dvor-3pX7b9eeCXSx8vBT0Dh/Screenshot-26_LI.jpg\" title=\"title.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/1549/dvor-3pX7b9eeCXSx8vBT0Dh/Screenshot-26_LI.jpg\"></a></div></li>\n<li>\n<p>The most important one I found that missing of status bar which includes angle of view, size of view, center and also changing the units. I think instead of showing file path in arbalest we can show the status bar.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/GceqwuWUir9Gk-9PKl4A6H7x/Screenshot-27_LI.jpg\">statusBar.jpg</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/GceqwuWUir9Gk-9PKl4A6H7x/Screenshot-27_LI.jpg\" title=\"statusBar.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/1549/GceqwuWUir9Gk-9PKl4A6H7x/Screenshot-27_LI.jpg\"></a></div></li>\n<li>\n<p>Currently Arbalest Help section is only showing Quick start . We can add a manual page which will be helpful but there is a part where it shows <code>synopsis</code> which shows a command but Arbalest didn't have a command line yet.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/3r3haz48-1R2FQj_GGcAUk1r/Screenshot-28_LI.jpg\">HelpSection.jpg</a> <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/j0wvQfhpzlAnK-iQzUlTuSey/Screenshot-29.png\">Manual.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/3r3haz48-1R2FQj_GGcAUk1r/Screenshot-28_LI.jpg\" title=\"HelpSection.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/1549/3r3haz48-1R2FQj_GGcAUk1r/Screenshot-28_LI.jpg\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/j0wvQfhpzlAnK-iQzUlTuSey/Screenshot-29.png\" title=\"Manual.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/1549/j0wvQfhpzlAnK-iQzUlTuSey/Screenshot-29.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>\n<p>In mged, the create section have primitives like Arbs which contains arb8, arb7... but there is no such like in arbalest. It only includes arb8 instead of Arbs section. Same applies to cone and ellipsoids. May be we should try to import those into arbalest?</p>\n</li>\n<li>Also I found some <code>shift key grips</code> and <code>effects</code> are not in arbalest. We can add those too.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/nuwZI17d8fZ1wDo_islg-mkc/Screenshot-2022-04-14-012817.png\">shiftKeyGrips.png</a><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/1549/nuwZI17d8fZ1wDo_islg-mkc/Screenshot-2022-04-14-012817.png\" title=\"shiftKeyGrips.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/1549/nuwZI17d8fZ1wDo_islg-mkc/Screenshot-2022-04-14-012817.png\"></a></div></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are many more features that can be implemented and many more I can explore what have been missing by comparing mged with arbalest. From above list of features, which will be important one? I am deciding to work on these and also the bugs that I have found during this GSoC. Since this is a long project, so I will write both improvements, fixes and features to arbalest.</p>",

You can find binary packages for Windows at <a href=\"https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases\">https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/releases</a>. This will install over 200 programs. Most of them are small command line tools. The most interesting for you are our old but still heavily used GUI mged and the more modern GUI archer.</li>\n<li>Go through the mged tutorial <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a>. The tutorial will show you how to create geometries, assign materials, create ray-trace images, and many more.</li>\n</ul>",

You fulfilled the third one, which es very helpful, but didn't managed the first two. For us, the first one is very important too: Describe in detail, what you did in the program (e.g.: start the program, click in the \"X\" button, click on the \"Y\" button) and what the result was (e.g.: crash with access violation).</p>\n<p>A bit about your code (we can move this discussion to github, if you prefer this): You introduced a <code>helpWidgetInstance</code> pointer, but why? It's true that if you create a new pointer variable, than it's on you to initialize it. But in this case, I would say, going without it would be the better solution. If you want to know why, look, where the real instance of HelpWidget are created.</p>",

I'm really interested in getting my hands dirty working on an open source project of big dimensions for the first time, and I thought that BRL-CAD would be the perfect choice, considering that I have some experience using SolidEdge, SolidWorks and Autodesk Inventor. I'm particularly interested in developing further the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/27\">new GUI arbalest</a>, and maybe (if i can get my head around it in the next few months) continuing the GSoC effort made by Himanshu, Vidit Jain, and many others.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I'm having trouble building <strong>MOOSE</strong> in order to then build <strong>arbalest</strong>.

However, your setting of brackets in class definitions make it worse (see line 772 in HACKING). Some spaces were really messed up, and you corrected them. Nevertheless, this is an own area of discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>New Functionality:</strong><br>\nHonestly, I haven't looked at how the behavior is changed by your code. I only saw that you even more hacked the standard decoration of the window for Linux. It is however already proven that this won't work for other window managers, especially on macOS. Rather, the way to go would be to remove such hacks from arbalest and use the standard elements from Qt and the window managers instead. This would improve the potability.</p>\n<p>Use themes instead. The basic native look and feel will be done by the native Qt libraries and window managers on Windows, Linux (KDE, Gnome, ...), and macOS (Aqua). Keep always in mind that we want to write a portable software. It's probably the easiest way to use a multi platform framework as Qt for the OS and window manager specific stuff.</p>",

For example, the qged qt console isn't just a simple command runner that prints results.  It's a proper Qt widget with behavior and functionality.  It has hooks to properly parse output from the libged commands, command completion, GUI update integration, buffered I/O, etc.</p>\n<p>In a sense, it's wanting to port the low-level to MOOSE, but also the arbalest to the qt widgets.

When enter/return is pressed, the <code>Console</code> will check if the command is valid, and if so execute it.</p>\n<h2>ConsoleCompleter</h2>\n<p><code>ConsoleCompleter</code> will work kinda like <code>GEDShellCompleter</code>. It will suggest a command based on what the user has already typed in the <code>Console</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Execution of commands</h1>\n<p>This is the most important part of the project. When the <code>ged_exec</code> wrapper \"<code>Parse</code>\" executes a certain <em>ged</em> command, there will be many things happening to both the database and the GUI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some stuff should be printed (eg: \"ls\") -&gt; <code>Console</code> output</li>\n<li>some object is added (eg: \"make\") -&gt; <code>ObjectTree</code> is changed, redraw <code>ObjectTreeWidget</code>, rerender <code>Viewports</code></li>\n<li>some object is modified (eg: \"p\") -&gt;  <code>ObjectTree</code> is changed, redraw <code>Properties</code>, rerender <code>Viewports</code></li>\n<li>some object is removed (eg: \"kill\") -&gt;  <code>ObjectTree</code> is changed, redraw <code>ObjectTreeWidget</code>, rerender <code>Viewports</code></li>\n<li>some object's visibilty is changed (eg: \"draw\", \"erase\") -&gt;  <code>ObjectTree</code> is changed, redraw <code>ObjectTreeWidget</code>, rerender <code>Viewports</code></li>\n<li>other stuff (eg: \"quit\") -&gt; quit application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imo it's a bad idea to make it so that the <code>Console</code> should handle all of this complexity by, based on the command executed, calling all the methods to modify the <code>ObjectTree</code>, change objects' visibilty state, redraw the <code>ObjectTreeWidget</code>/<code>Properties</code> if necessary,  refresh the <code>GeometryRenderer</code>, rerender the <code>Viewports</code>, and so on.</p>\n<p>The best way to handle all this complexity (again, this is my opinion) is to make it so to not \"make the GUI handle the <code>ObjectTree</code>\", but to \"<strong>make the <code>ObjectTree</code>handle the GUI</strong>\".</p>\n<p>I will give an example on what I mean by this statement: let's say that I want to add an \"Arb8\". I have two ways of doing this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Menu bar -&gt; Create -&gt; Arb8</li>\n<li>CLI -&gt; \"make test arb8\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of these ways will modify the database by adding a new object through MOOSE. The first one will use <code>Database::Add</code> and the second one will use <code>CommandString::Parse</code>.</p>\n<p>Then, the presence of this new object should modify something in the GUI (again, I'm talking about <code>ObjectTree</code>, <code>ObjectTreeWidget</code>, <code>Viewport</code>, <code>Properties</code>, ...). Instead of making it so that the menu bar <code>QAction</code> or the <code>Console</code> has to call a bunch of stuff to make these things in order (for example when <code>QAction createArb8Act</code> is pressed, it adds and \"Arb8\", and then calls a bunch of stuff to readjust the GUI accordingly), the <code>ObjectTree</code> itself could handle all of this by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>adding the object to the db</li>\n<li>\n<p>realizing that a new object has been added to the db, so:</p>\n<p>- the new object should be present in the object tree widget<br>\n  - the new object visibilty state should be \"visible\"<br>\n  - the new object should be selected<br>\n  - ...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>realizing that an object is now \"visible\", so:</p>\n<p>- the object should be drawn<br>\n  - the object should be seen as \"visible\" in the object tree widget<br>\n  - the object's parent should be seen as \"has children visible\" in the object tree widget<br>\n  - ...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>realizing that an object is now \"selected\", so:</p>\n<p>- the object should be seen as selected in the object tree widget<br>\n  - the object properties should appear in the properties dockable<br>\n  - ...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>...</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So basically the <code>ObjectTree</code> will modifiy its database and its internal properties (eg: <code>objectIdVisibilityStateMap</code>), and then modify the GUI accordingly. This way all the GUI parts of arbalest will be much cleaner and more related to GUI stuff, while <code>ObjectTree</code> will be the most \"complex and low level\" part of arbalest, that will handle 99% of the calls to the underlying MOOSE's/brlcad's stuff.</p>",
