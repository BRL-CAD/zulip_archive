        "content": "<p>Hey Team,<br>\nSo over these few days, I have been looking at the things which we need to follow and things related to the organization that we follow.<br>\nSo as mentioned in my proposal in the first phase our most important target is to get the base project page up and running including all the perks like  Responsiveness, i18n, lining, modern programming techniques for scss, and more. This is primarily the boilerplate stuff which is the first task of this specific project.</p>\n<p>So, after exploring the options like Hugo, Next.js, Gatsby.js, CRA, etc, I concluded to use Next.js<br>\nThe reason to go with is basically react, features like SSG, SEO, and the ability to add basic APIs, and its fast<br>\nPlus its react so it will make the work much easier and more flexible. The boilerplate by default supports scss out of the box and also has base support of eslint (We can integrate any flavor of eslint we want, I prefer Airbnb-lint tough). Moreover, the i18n support is also good for react so that's a plus point. <br>\nSo once we set up this boilerplate, I can start working on the UI part of the site, where we will start with the home page including all of its components which will be reusable and adaptable depending on what we want them to do.<br>\nPlease share your ideas and views on this <br>\nCC <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"403746\">@Amanjot Singh</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"103542\">@Erik</span></p>",

Good to see you pitching ideas to make the website perfect according to our requirements. Having dark mode, animations and SEO is definitely gonna make a good impact on the application. Though I'm not sure about when we can do that, probably after the current timeline of the project. Also, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"102902\">@Sean</span> can confirm if we need to add any other feature to the website that might have higher priority.<br>\ncc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"102939\">@Daniel Rossberg</span></p>",

Note that the gallery does not have to stay in piwigo.  It's really just meant to be a convenient place to see a curated set of interesting images and could be managed in many different ways.  Note that most of our most recent images aren't even in the gallery -- they're on the facebook page.  So lots of disconnect.  It'd be nice if images could be somehow synced automatically, or pulled from facebook manually, or posts to the website gallery also post to facebook, etc.   Don't know what are options are there.</p>",

The new doc repo generates a static set of files, but that'll need to seamlessly integrate with the website in both styling and organization.  Initial integration can be very simple, just drop it in and link to it, but that's only the start .  It needs to not look like a totally separate site and ideally should not duplicate information.   For example it might make sense to turn the previous \"features\" pages into doc pages.  Or maybe the gallery images should reside in the docs repo as a showcase, and the website repo processes it down and integrates it all together.  Or maybe we keep the gallery separate like it is, but then we will need to document everything clearly as to how things get edited and revision controlled.</p>",
