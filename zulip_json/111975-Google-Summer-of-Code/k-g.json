At t=0, there are some quantity of pipe bends implied in an increasing count depending on the width of the wire and width of the spool.  As it's pulled out, each t=XX would geometrically reduce the number of bends/rotations.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that there's currently a function to do that, but that it's not terribly complicated to think about what would be needed for a simple/naive implementation (sans and sort of compression).</p>",
