Please, have a look at <a href=\"https://opencax.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://opencax.github.io\">https://opencax.github.io</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues\">https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues</a> for a list of their project ideas. There are some Qt GUI project ideas among them, for example.</p>\n<p>No matter with which CAD project you want to work, the first step would be to install the software and make yourself familiar with it. Next, you have to download the source code, compile, install, and run it. When you made up a list of your favorite project ideas, you should discuss it with the mentors.</p>\n<p>The links to the corresponding BRL-CAD how-tos are  <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf\">https://brlcad.org/w/images/c/cf/Introduction_to_MGED.pdf</a> (mged GUI user manual), <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/SVN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/SVN\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/SVN</a> (download source code), <a href=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling\">https://brlcad.org/wiki/Compiling</a> (build from source code).</p>",
