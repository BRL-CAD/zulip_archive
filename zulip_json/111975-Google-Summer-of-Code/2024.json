There was a great Google kick-off meeting last week for admins and mentors that I know at least <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"102939\">@Daniel Rossberg</span> and I were at, maybe others as well.  This is going to be the 20th year of the program!  I'm going to send the usual call-for-mentors e-mail out here in a bit, but there's at least one topic that might be good to discuss more fluidly, namely how our project ideas are presented.</p>\n<p>This was one of the topics discussed at the kick-off meeting that had me reflecting on the challenges we've had the past couple years attracting student proposals across all partner orgs.   Google specifically called out not just pointing candidates at an issue tracker -- unless we really tailor it to the program, which we do, but the underlying point remains about making the list more reader-friendly and scannable.  To address that, I'm wondering how much work it would be to \"publish\" the combined list to a single page? </p>\n<p>We also need to balance the number of topic ideas so that there's 1-3 ideas per mentor, namely that there's a specific mentor behind the proposed idea and that mentor is specifically (and contemporaneously) advocating for that project idea, not just a big list of things needed in the past that we'll find a mentor for if we get a good proposal.</p>\n<p>The end goal for our ideas list, assuming a goal of 6-8 slots, would be an ideas list with about 20-25 ideas total, ideally randomly presented on each view, with titles and summary descriptions curated to be easily understood (and then perhaps linking to the issue page with more details).</p>",
