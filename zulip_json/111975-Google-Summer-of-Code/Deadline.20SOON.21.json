Please note that 1) you must submit your final PDF before the deadline and 2) we can't see the final PDF until after the deadline so submit a draft first.  There are ZERO exceptions, no matter the reason, for failing to submit on time.  Every year, someone waits until the last minute and cries because the website was busy in the last minutes or they tried to submit 2 seconds after the deadline.  There are literally ZERO exceptions by Google, so get yours in early and update often as needed.</p>",
