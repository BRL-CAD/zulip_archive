I was initially interested in the front end revamp for OGV, since I knew HTML, CSS, PHP and had experience involving graphic designing. But now I am interested in converting MGED from Tk to Qt. I am well acquainted with C/C++ but Qt is new for me. I believe that this project would give me the opportunity to learn Qt.<br>\nWhat project do you think would be appropriate for me ?  <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
