There are at least two approaches to get this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interfacing the command line interpreter of the mged shell (libged)</li>\n<li>An object oriented, functional approach, maybe MOOSE based</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I would like to see an API, which is easy to use for people familiar with Python. I.e., it should not look exotic. However, at the end, it would be on you to write the proposal.</p>",

Use the example provided there as starting point for a C++ way of working with geometries.</p>\n<p>Then maybe, you can provide us with an idea about a Python way.
