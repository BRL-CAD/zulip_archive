If you didn't get selected, I'd be glad to give you feedback (public or private, please specify) on your proposal.  It was a competitive year and we simply couldn't accept everyone we wanted, but I hope you'll remain involved and active with BRL-CAD.  Using BRL-CAD in your studies can be a great way to build experience, and help you make an even better proposal next year or get started on a project of your own.  If you were selected, congratulations and let's get started!  Your next step is turning those proposals into project plans.
