The most simple form of this is to keep a copy of any objects that are changed or deleted. Since we can undo objects added bquoteply deleting them, we don't need to do anything special other than keep track of them.</p>\n<p>Note that there's LOTS of ways to implement this sort of undo. For example, here's a really simple setup where (for example) we decide to store our backups in the same .g file using a simple numeric suffix that denotes what change. For example, db.g might have in it: objA objB objC objA;1 objA;2 objA;3 objB;2 objC;4</p>\n<p>The current state is three objects: objA objB objC</p>\n<p>The most recent change was some edit to objC. When the change was made to objC, we save the previous state is in objC;4 .. so undoing the command is a simple to replace objC with objC;4</p>\n<p>The next undo restores objA to a previous state (via objA;3).</p>\n<p>The one after that was a simultaneous change to objA and objB, so we restore both from objA;2 and objB;2 </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our last discussion on the partial method</p>",

That's how I'm able to know I need to update the visuals for objects in qged after a ged command is run - I zero out all directory edit_flags, run the command, and then check to see if any of them were tripped.  Anything with the flag set needs to get redrawn.</p>\n<p>This may not be suitable for the undo mechanism, but at least for my purposes it is simple and effective - I don't have to care about the details of what the logic called by ged_exec did, so I'm completely isolated from any command logic or command changes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112516\">@starseeker</span> ... really hate to say it, but that is a straight up scope violation for that structure.  I mean I get how and why it works and why you thought to put it there, but I do not think it's right from a design perspective.   I hadn't seen that commit yet or I would thought it worth discussion. </p>\n<p>To frame it by way of an analogy, it's like cleaning staff putting stickers or sharpie circles around stores on the public directory kiosk in mall to help keep track of which stores have been cleaned recently.  Sure it works for them, works GREAT for them... but that's in no way what the directory is for and is irrelevant/distracting/confusing to essentially everyone else.</p>\n<p>In CS terms, it's a data specialization that doesn't intrinsically fit the structure (from both an OO perspective or a data-driven procedural perspective).  It's also couping a new concept (a notion of edit state and/or views) to what was otherwise a pure database construct with no awareness or linkage to views, edit state, interface.  Def minor point, but it's also a waste of a couple bytes per object, so it's that much more pressure on memory use, cache misses, context switch overhead.</p>\n<p>Now that's not to suggest that another structure is more appropriate, it's specifically the notion of what an edit flag means in a general sense on a directory entry.  Is a non-zero value supposed to mean recently edited?  What constitutes recently?  What does a value of -8 mean?  Directory structs were stateless, and that appears to be some sort of live state -- so when does it change?  Can my code change it? </p>\n<p>You can probably achieve the same effect by using the u_data pointer or by adding a callback so calling code is notified when something happens to the directory entry.</p>",

At least, I do not see undo as an intrinsic feature of the .g, and would not belong in \"libg\" if it existed (thus doesn't belong in librt currently).  It's a higher level application-level construct, thus belongs somewhere in libged or higher.</p>\n<p>As we think of undoing commands, that to me says libged is the most appropriate place for the logic to reside and/or be registered.   If I run a killtree, I'd expect  undo to reverse the entire killtree in one step as a single transaction (which is a concept librt/libg knows nothing about).  It might conceptually fit if we introduced transactions to librt/libg, but that's unquestionably in scope for libged today where the killtree command exists, where it's aware of the set of things it's going to change.</p>",
