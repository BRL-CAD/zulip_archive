Secondly, even mediawiki had an interest in such an extension when we started with OGV. On last GSoC mentor summit I had the chance to talk with mentor from mediawiki and it seems that requirement has still not been met. If BRL-CAD could be one of the supported platforms on mediawiki and hence later wikipedia, that I believe would be great. <br>\nRegarding difficulty, what I am thinking about is embedding our OGV viewer into mediawiki, so that as we keep working on our web viewer the mediawiki extension keeps improving along with.  That embedding of the OGV viewer would be a comparatively simpler task.</p>",
