There is a lot to learn on the python bindings topic, but you're welcome to propose whatever you think sounds like a great project idea, tailored to your knowledge.  Do know that there has been some work in the past on python bindings for BRL-CAD that might be worth looking into.  You don't have to use them, or you can build off what they did and take things further -- you propose what you want to do.

It's possible it's just renamed, maybe \"ctypesgen\" or something similar, or it's possible that entire code path was replaced with a different mechanism.

If so, a pybind11-based approach could potentially provide stronger type safety and easier long-term maintenance. If a pure C interface is preferred, I would instead plan around the CPython C API directly.<br>\nI will also review kanzure’s and nmz787’s prior efforts carefully to better understand their architectural decisions and where complexity arose, so I can factor that into a more concrete proposal.<br>\nI’d like to make sure whatever approach I take is sustainable and aligned with the project’s long-term direction.</p>",

That way we get stronger compile-time guarantees and a more stable API, even if it means a bit more upfront work.<br>\nI think that gives a better long-term balance between maintainability and stability, but I’ll experiment a bit more before finalizing the approach.</p>",
